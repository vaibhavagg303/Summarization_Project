Im apparently staying in my car tonight in the parking lot of a hotel on the last night of my reservation THAT I GODAMN PAID FOR!!! 
Let this be a warning! DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BOOK OR STAY WITH THIS INCOMPETENT CHAIN!! No, I checked out today. The individual who took my keys said theyd return with the managers number. They never returned. By the way, this place is barely  months old and already a dump. I reeks of marijuana and I shall attach pictures Disgusting how unkept this inn is! The office was almost always shuttered during my stay here. I dont know how your hotels are franchised, but your corporate office might want to take a closer look. This so-called hotel owner is absolutely trashing your corporate name.Because right now your corporate name is absolute garbage in my mind. You couldnt pay me to stay at another one of your hotels again I would like the last night of my stay refunded. I paid for four nights and was provided with three...the opportunity to fix the keys came and went. 
Refund the final night, and well call it even. Confirmation number: 

Check in on Monday , /15/20

Tampa, Fl  You guys really need to investigate that location because they are absolutely destroying your reputation and company name I hope so because Id hate to have to get BBB and or the State Attorneys Office Consumer Affairs Division involved. I assure I will if necessary. I do have photographic and gps evidence to prove my case. Since your manager is unprofessional and unwilling to work with me, I will be taking the matter up with a consumer lawyer from a local news channel. Im sure the negative publicity your corporation is about to receive on live news will be worth not reimbursing a customer one night stay. Consumers deserve the right to know what a racket Choice  Hotels is and what absolutely terrible service you provide (or dont provide).","I am staying at the Brandon, Fl location at Falkenberg Road.

" Checking into the Clarion Denver. There's a sign that says must wear a mask.
No one, not even the staff! Good morning. We are at the Denver Clarion Central. We arrived yesterday evening (July ). Reservation is under Michael Turnipseed. The person behind the desk this morning was wearing a mask, but they aren't enforcing anyone else wearing one.  Here is a photo from our check in last night. When we got to the room, there were no towels.  Just fyi.
My husband wanted you to know This is my last break before a major surgery. I would rather you all take care of it. Honestly, I would feel uncomfortable as apparently no one here cares.

"Please tell me how to make a complaint on one of your hotels; my wife and have stayed in quite a few over the last  years as we traveled to see our children, but this last event will probably be our last with Econolodge Econolodge Lodge, Lookout Mountain, TN; Reservation number  for Friday /26. When we arrived we were greeted by the attendant/ mgr and given a room. WE had requested ground floor(we are senior adults) of course he said none available; we had made our reservation over a week earlier. Made our way to the rd floor couldn't get in our room,  get in our room, had to go back down stairs to get him to give us another key, he even went up to help. Got in our room, very musty smelling, TV wouldn't work, except manually; went back down stairs because he wouldn't answer the phone. I told him we were not happy and concerned about having to constantly come find him, he advised he was tired of me complaining, very rude and disrespectful the whole time, finally got him to issue a refund and we went to another hotel closer  to Chattanooga.

" I've never felt more scared to stay in a hotel.  Not only was the housekeeper still cleaning the room at pm when my check in time was at  there was a man smoking weed on the balcony.

My husband told me to leave and get another hote.l   in Thomson Georgia is disgusting and scary.  Don't stay here!  your econo lodge in Thomson Georgia is disgusting and scary.  I felt so unsafe that I didn't care about my refund.   The hotel is run down and honestly as soon as I saw it I knew I couldn't stay there.  The pictures online made it look nice but that was a clear deception.  The housekeeper looked worn out and possibly on drugs.  I brought my dogs upstairs so I could go down and get my stuff.  Once I was back in the room and for to look around it was just disgusting.  The mini fridge had dents and paint on it.  The bathroom tile in the corner had black stuff that looked disgusting.  I was grossed out.  I decided to leave and on the hallway there was a man smoking weed and he looked scary and I felt very unsafe.  The whole hotel looks dangerous and like it is used for drug dealing and prostitutes.  I told the clerk I was scared to stay there and she said since I had used the room I couldn't have a refund.  I didn't stay in the room more than  minutes.  This hotel should be inspected and someone should come in and do an overhaul. I care more about my safety than any amount of money.  I guess you get what you pay for.  But as a tip I would have someone higher up come and do a walk through of this place because there is no way anyone of you would stay at this dump. I greatly appreciate that.  I know that every state or city has areas that are more prevalent to crime and I learned after the fact that Thomson Georgia has one of the highest crime rates per capita in America.  It's sad to say that most of the hotels in that area will have guest feeling very unsafe.  However I know that when I go back to visit my friend I will stay in Augusta.  I appreciate the points for a stay at another one of your hotels and I'm sure I will be able to use it in the future.  I want to let you know that I am the wife of a police officer and he has taught me to be very aware of my surroundings.  Had we looked up the area he never would have let me stay in Thomson.  I am not currently a member but my phone number is -478-0041 email  and my address  village Creek Lane apt.

Again I appreciate your quick response and I hope that upper management and the owner can work together to improve the quality of the Econo Lodge in Thomson Georgia.

"I just wanted to remind you that the manager of this hotel has refused to return my calls, Expedia's calls, your emails and the Better Business Bureau's email. Clearly your company does not care about the damage this franchise is doing to your brand's reputation. I have contacted the hotel, you have contacted the hotel, the better business bureau, Expedia has contacted the hotel. Expedia wants to refund but can't because of the hotel. I can't dispute the charges because they were made. If the hotel is going to say no they could at least return a phone call otherwise it's bad business and cowardly. Yes it does reflect on Choice Hotels because they cary your name and despite the manager point blank ignoring you, the customer, Expedia and the better business bureau there are zero reprecutions to the hotel.

"I signed my husband up for Choice Hotels to save money on a room I had already booked and then ended up double booking a room for the same night.  I called Choice Hotels immediately to let them know what I had done and they cancelled the booking and rebooked the reservation for one room, one night. I ended up with not one, but three charges on my checking account!  Called Choice Hotels reservations and they assured me the charges would fall off within -10 business days.  They did not.  Called again  weeks later, same line of bull.  Charges will fall off within -10 business days.  Now, this has been three weeks with two extra charges on my account of $69.60. To say I am dissapointed and angry would be an understatement. After this is resolved, I will cancel my subscription with Choice Hotels for not taking care of business.

"Michelle Wyatt yes.. I never even get my money back.. THE WORST!!!! WoodSpring Suites I already done that and I never got a respond from you.. some guy name Julio got everything  from me and that was it never hear from you guys again.  WoodSpring Suites Michelle Wyatt They ask you for all information  on a private message  to look like they are really going to fix it on social media but once you send it private message  they don't  even look at it. I screenshot  the message  so you can see it but I can posted them.. it is a waste of time trying for them to do what's right! Good luck WoodSpring Suites  Michelle Wyatt I send you a private  message  so you can see how maybe the blocked me so they didn't  get the information. They  sure don't care.  WoodSpring Suites how I  can send it if you guys blocked me  Thank you for the fast respond and yes indeed that's the address. As you can imagine Mr. Julio I'm a single mom and the safety for my family and myself is very important. At the time we arrived it was :30 P.M. I was very tired since I drove  hours from West Palm Beach to South Carolina. The place looked dirty from the minute we walked in but my kids were hungry and very tired and since I didn't know the area so I had no choice but to stay. I  was told about your non smoking policies yet the whole place smell like cigarettes and more. I don't smoke and the smell of cigarettes was unbearable, elevator was filthy falling apart, and the nasty mop behind the bathroom door that when I tried to remove it a roach came crawled out. I cried as you can imagine but we need it to get some rest. Then about :27a.m as I mentioned the incident with the rooms next to me about the guy beating his girlfriend up and she was crying and screaming for help let me tell you that one knows how terrifying and horrible experience that was for us and believe me we couldn't sleep the night. I also forgot to mention that there was three other single moms at the hotel from my son's team. After the incident I got in touch with them as we all had different room and  they were terrified as I was.  and we all felt very unsafe. Mr. I'm going to send you my involvement with the  call and some pictures of how this building is in a bad shape. In the morning all the moms met up by the lobby at :30a.m trying to talk to anyone but it was unsuccessful since front desk was closed gate it down until pm we need it to bring our kids to the Ripken fields park for open ceremony so therefore we couldn't wait. During the time we dropped our kids and desperately trying to get to a different place for our kids to feel safe and able to have a better baseball/vacation experience. We all able to find something better but it wasn't until  p.m. so when we went back to the woodspring to talk to the manager Angelica Houston but she was very unpleasant at first as I tried to explain the reason why we needed  to leave then she told me very rudely that she couldn't control their guesses behavior but since we wanted to leave and it was after pm she was going to charge for two nights at a higher rate since we weren't staying the whole week. I thought this was very unfair. We missed our kids opening ceremony and it wasn't our fault that you guys weren't able to fulfill our expectations so Mrs. Houston became loud and told us that she was going to charge us  per night and she was going to refund the rest b/c she didn't want to deal with this anymore.. That's was very poor customer service and bad management. I will send you a copy of my reservation Yined Ramos /15-6/22  room number  That's exactly what happened the last time and nothing got on my behalf but thank you for trying OK great! Thank you again!

"really gonna have to fight the quality inn in gainesville if they dont REFUND ME Hello! I dont have a confirmation number for you because we never received an email and the front desk took the receipt back, but the arrival date was July ,  and the name on the reservation was Terresa Frazier or Emily Frazier, Im not sure exactly which one it ended up under. 

When we called to make the reservation, we specifically asked if the pool was open and were told yes, so we proceeded to make the drive to the hotel. Upon check in, as we made our way to our room, we discovered that the pool was completely drained and unusable, which made us upset because we had specifically asked while making the reservation that morning and had been lied to. 

We returned to the front desk to ask about this, and were told that the pool was closed due to the coronavirus, which we completely understand! But we were still upset at being lied to. The front desk worker offered us a full refund, which we accepted and then left to find another hotel. However, instead of reversing the charge to my card, she double charged my card, so I now have  charges of $113 for a room we didnt even stay in. 

We called back once we discovered this, only to be hung up on several times. We finally got ahold of somebody outside that specific hotel and they tried to call the front desk as well, to no avail. Eventually we were able to connect to the front desk worker who had helped us. She insisted that she had run the refund, that it showed as refunded on her side, and that she would forward us the paperwork showing the refund via email. However, we have yet to receive such an email, and my bank account still shows the two charges, neither of which have been refunded.  The last  of the card are , and the address of the hotel is: 

Quality Inn Gainesville  Medal of Honor Blvd
Gainesville, TX  Okay, thanks. But has the second charge also been refunded? Because they charged me the $113 twice. Also, we havent received any invoice. Which email did it send to? Okay, then Ill definitely contact my bank, because there are two charges on it.

"On July th, when I first arrived at the Rodeway Inn in Augusta, GA it was stressed that it was a non smoking establishment and there would be a considerable fee if caught smoking. I am pregnant and do not smoke anyway so that wouldnt be an issue. Upon getting to my room it immediately smelt like smoke and there were ashes on the night tables and carpet. I called to the front desk and they moved me to another room. My husband and I unloaded our things then went to go get pizza and brought it back to the room. While eating the pizza I happened to look in the corner of the room and saw a dead roach carcass. As this was a clear indication this establishment was not up to par with cleanliness and sanitation and being pregnant I did not want to stay any longer and asked for a refund. I was RUDELY told since I had been there several hours (2 hours and most of it was out getting pizza) I would not get a refund. I was also not checked out even though I left and wanted a check out receipt. I was told the system could not check me out until the next day. I am in the United States Air Force and I was staying because my air conditioning went out and would be repaired the next day. I am extremely unsatisfied and this is the second time Choice Hotels have not been up to standards. I called Choice Hotels customer service and all that was done was to file a formal complaint. I feel I should receive a refund or I would like to see the manager on duty that day penalized. I will never stay at a Choice Hotels location ever again because of my poor treatment and I will be informing my unit of said treatment I received and they will inform other service members in the area not to go to this establishment. Until something is done or I am contacted regarding this matter I will take my story to all social media and I will recount my past Choice Hotels experience as well, which I had not complained about and did not leave a review.

"Hello,  how can I make a formal complaint about a hotel and their manager? We booked our stay through Priceline.  We got to the hotel and it wreaked of smoke.  The place was filthy and the staff was not wearing masks,  as mandated by the Governor of Ohio, due to the Covid  pandemic.  The front staff worker was rude. They tried to charge us extra for our children. We actually inquired about a second room but the worker refused to give us the Priceline price.  He sad Priceline is just trying to get their cut,  repeatedly.  I said we could easily book it on Priceline, but just decided to leave.  We immediately walked out,  without getting a room key and called Priceline to cancel,  literally minutes after booking. Wet did not feel comfortable staying there.  Priceline said they needed to call the hotel,  while I waited.  They got back on the line and said the worker refused to cancel our reservation and that the Priceline agent would have to call the manager in the morning.  I waited until afternoon and hadn't gotten a call back,  so I called Priceline.  The agent called the manager and was told that the manager would not cancel our reservation,  give a refund or make any concessions. I decided to call and speak to the manager and try to explain the situation. I was calm and never raised mmt voice. I was absolutely shocked by the response I received. I explained the situation and was told to hold on,  several times, before he got back on the line and told me, you need to speak to Priceline,  they need to cancel it.  I tried to attempt to tell him Priceline told me that he had to approve the cancellation,  emphasizing that his staff was rude and wasn't obeying the law,  regarding the pandemic. He then hung up on me.  I called him back and he said,  ""what do you want me to do?"" I said I'd like a full refund. He said no,  Priceline told us not to cancel.  I told them I called Priceline within minutes of booking to cancel and that his staff member refused.  I told him we never even got a room key.  He then began to yell and cuss at me.  I told him I'd report him to corporate for not complying with Covid  protocols.  He then told me ""we don't give a damn about Covid  protocol,  we don't give a damn about you! Call the police,  call the governor,  call corporate, we don't give a damn! You're paying! Toy deal with Priceline,  Ideal with Priceline. Do not call me again!"" He then hung up on me a second time.  Is this the type of service your hotels provides??? I am appalled! It was Quality Inn Huron,  W Cleveland Rd E, Huron, OH  the manager's name was Chris.

So disappointed for a room that was almost $200.... Hello, I just received a comment from my review on Grand Haven, MI Rodeway Inn.  Unfortunately I wasn't given a confirmation number or receipt (I had to reserve this room over the phone as the website wasn't allowing the reservation to go through) but the name on the reservation was Carissa Stroh, we checked in on /24/2020 and checked out the following morning. Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide. I also took some photos the morning before leaving the room, most spills and things we had already cleaned up but you can still see plenty of what went wrong. :( I would like to also say though, how positive our experience was at Quality Inn in Hudsonville, MI the following day-the woman at check-in was very kind and the room seemed very clean! (That one was reserved online #60809040) Thank you so much for the follow up, I appreciate the offer and would accept the points of course.

"I know businesses are going through a hard time. But i think all hotels should have flexible bookings right now. Things change daily during a pandemic and at least credit my account to use at a later date if you cant refund me. Will be avoiding Choice hotels for while  Thank you for offering to review my concern. I have already emailed the contact page and received the answer that I was not able to receive a refund because I wanted to save money and paid in advance. I totally understand I chose to do that. Just seems that other hotels are still flexible with their typical nonrefundable rates due to the pandemic and limited travel. My friend had to cancel her wedding that had a room block at Comfort Inn and Suites in Fremont, Ohio (Beane/Harpring) that was scheduled for /7-8/9 due to travel restrictions where they would be coming from. I had originally booked with the block, but when found out it was cheaper for me as a member to book in advance and also get a king bed instead of two queen beds, we canceled the block room and rebooked with confirmation number . It would be great to have an account credit to use at a later date when I have a reason to travel. But even if nothing can be done for me, I would at least like the room to be released so the hotel isnt waiting for us/someone else could use the room. Thanks.","'I think all hotels should have flexible bookings right now. Things change daily during a pandemic and at least credit my account to use at a later date if you cant refund me,' he says.

"I'd like to report on my recent stay at a Choice Hotel.  I would contact through the website, where I am a Choices Member, but the site will not recognize my user name or e-mail address.  I attempted to sign up again, but it says my email address is already in use, even while not recognizing it. I spent  of the last  nights at the Comfort Suites in Exton, PA.  This is the hotel chosen by my employer for all employees in this area.  Perhaps no longer, after I speak with them.  Frankly, it's the first time I have spent time at a hotel where I felt unsafe. I'll detail some reasons I felt that way.  (1) there appears to be people living in a car in the parking lot.  Maybe not, but call it what you will.   or  people, laying across the car seats with all four doors open, for hours and hours on end, the car surrounded by the trash they are throwing on the ground. A man getting off the elevator with three luggage carts, totally bereft of luggage.  They were piled with loose bedding, dirty clothing, household supplies, and no less than three slow cookers with crusted dried material all over them.  The man was in no better repair than his belongings.... Torn shirt and dirty torn shorts. Now, in the front of the building, parked directly in front of the lobby, a young man in a car.  Her's parked there, during my stray, /7.  I am staying for work, and left the hotel before am each day.  He was there, in his car, on his phone.  Back at various times for lunch in my room.... he was there.  Back for the night by pm, and he's there.  Always on his phone, and always staring at people coming and going.  What is he there for?  Who can say for sure, but I vote he's a freelance pharmaceutical salesman.  VERY freelance. On the other side of the hotel, there appeared the same woman day after day, near a propped open door.   Sitting, leaning on the wall, wandering, but never far from the door and always dressed haphazardly.  My whole stay, she could be found there perhaps every other time I drove past.  What is she doing?  Again, who can say, but I suspect she is a young lade of negotiable affection working from a hotel room.  Not in a high price bracket either. These little vignettes should illustrate my stay nicely.  Take them for what you will.  As for myself, I'll elect to stay elsewhere when my work requires it, even if it costs more. My name was on the reservation, on behalf of Universal Technical Institute.  I stayed there  nights last week and  nights this week.  The company puts instructors in that hotel often, and there's usually at least one or two staying at any given week day.   Beyond that, I see nothing else that I can say, nor anything you can do for me.  I don't intend to stay there again. I should also mention.... Our admin were under the impression they were a 'corporate account' and were being given discounted rates.  When I gave them screen shots of the rates I, as an individual, could get at any time.... they were somewhat perturbed.  All these years they have been paying MORE than average, not a discounted rate.  and  I have no issues because i do not intend to ever use that hotel again.   I'll assume this was a mindless automatic response programmed by an idiot.  Good luck in your future ventures.","The Comfort Suites in Exton, PA is the hotel chosen by my employer for all employees.

"Good morning.  I booked and stayed in a quality  inn in Indianapolis Indiana using my points. Unfortunately I was incredibly underwhelmed.  The stay was one of the worst Ive experienced in any choice hotel.  Let start by saying if I had other options I likely would have stayed somewhere else.  When you first walk in from entrance your greeted with a yellow bucket in center of walkway collecting rain water, the elevator was also out of service.  The pool was covered ( one of the reasons we chose this location).   I assume because of the pandemic. Im including pictures to illustrate the issues at this partners location.  Our journey up the rickety Ill maintained stairs we were greeted by several hornets and their nest, I brought this to the managers attention who killed hornets same day.  When we arrived to room we had to force door open after key card surprisingly worked.  The hallways all filled constantly with the smell of marijuana. And cieling tiles missing in spots and/or discoloring from leaks.  All this was noticed before room door was opened.  Once upon entering room we noticed stains on the cover pieces on beds and stains on floor.   The multiple discoloration on Ceilings assuming from leaks again. Multiple cracks in plaster on walls and ants on center table.  Mold/caked on dust found in exhaust and bath foundation was incredibly squishy and caulk joints were cracked so Im sure that will need extensive repair.  I have pictures of more I will include and can explain upon request.  I would say our stay was less then quality We ended up leaving a day early due to the issues what are my options for the third day reimbursement?  We did bring these issues to Pat King the manager and he was apologetic and that the room will go through a Thorough cleaning and offered to put us in a different room.  However he stated that the hotel was fully booked and would have a room available later in day.  We were so put off by the issues stated that we didnt feel comfortable staying in a different room.

"Do Not use this company to  book ur hotel. They will not help u at all with customer service if you get frauded by one if their hotels. Im living through a nightmare with them as we speak Liz. I have called at least  times and emailed  times. I was told I would receive a phone call back from a supervisor about fraudulent charged by one of their hotels.

I made a reservation to stay at one of your hotels on July th in Seaside Heights NJ at the Rodeway Inn Island Beach state Park. When we arrived it was deplorable. Nothing like pictured on the website. The rooms were filthy and smelled of smoke. Air conditioners barely worked and had black mold growing on the inside of them. The hallways were filthy and smelled. The windows in the hotel hallways were open with no screens. The only way into the hotel a side entrance that did not lock and anyone could gain access. The beds were queen mattress on full size frames which were actually dangerous. When my wife sat on bed she fell off the side. We were appalled at the condition of this hotel and their websites description and pictures were not representative of the actual disarray of this establishment.  We told the attendant that we were not happy and did not feel safe to stay at the hotel and wanted our reservation cancelled and refunded. He disagreed and then we proceeded to call choice hotels. The person on choice hotels called the establishment and he was argumentative and disrespectful. He refused to cancel our reservation or give us our money back. We WILL NOT pay for the  nights at a hotel we did not stay at and HE DID charge my credit card for all  night two rooms totalling $869.92. Now I was told a supervisor would call the gentleman and take care of it. That has not happened. I have called on the th, the st , TH, TH OF of July and August at. All times nothing was done. We ended up staying at another of their establishments for the  night of July , , , . Now Choice Hotels is are our liaisons to the hotels they represent. We use Choice Hotels for that exact reason. Either he refunds our money or choice hotels refunds our money but someone needs to take care of this injustice. It is unacceptable that a hotel they represent is in such a deplorable condition and that they endorse it. Still nothing has been done.!!!! Our case number is   Choice Hotels i pmd you. No reply Choice Hotels still no reply Still no reply. Honestly as expected from ur company Still no reply Still.  No.  Reply Im not happy with the outcome of this situation in ANY way. Two weeks for a response from anyone? Really. The hotel stole  dollars from me and i get a partial refund of my stolen money and im just supposed to hang my tail and go away? Really? At this point maybe i need to contact a lawyer or the ney york states attorney I have contacted the president of the company, patrick pacious in regards to this situation",Liz has called Choice Hotels at least times and emailed times. She was told she would receive a phone call back from a supervisor about fraudulent charged by one of their hotels. When we arrived at the hotel it was deplorable. The rooms were filthy and smelled of smoke. Air conditioners barely worked and had black mold growing on the inside of them.,dont use choice hotels help u at all customer service,"Do Not use this company to  book ur hotel. They will not help u at all with customer service if you get frauded by one if their hotels. Im living through a nightmare with them as we speak Liz. I have called at least  times and emailed  times.

"As a Frontline nurse and Diamond member, I am very disappointed in the current promotions. The Frontline discount is miniscule at best, and actually higher than the regular member rate and the stay twice and get a free night advertising is very deceiving. Even the hotel staff don't understand it. I am currently at a hotel where the staff told me that I would get the points every rd night, as long as I paid by the day vs the week. I realized today that I have not been getting the points. After having my call dropped twice after long waits, customer service finally answers and explains the ridiculous terms and say that nothing can be done for me. They actually told me to check out and stay somewhere else every other night in order to get the advertised points.

"Hello. I hope that this finds its way to the correct individual please view pictures as well.

We arrived for our one night stay in Lubbock, TX (5816 th St, Martin Patel owns) Saturday (August th) evening around :00; we checked in and proceeded to our room (418). We check our rooms before settling in, normally, but especially now with Covid being prevalent. The first problem we found was leftover food in the refrigerator but it didn't stop there. There was a dirty, moldy type substance on the utensil wrapping by the coffee maker, a used, wet, dirty towel on the bathroom counter, and the toilet didn't flush. The front desk individual (who was more concerned with mask wearing than overall cleanliness ) moved us to a new room (406). Awesome! Nope. New room had used dental floss on the floor, hair of some sort (I honestly don't want to know what kind) in the beds, beer cans hidden behind the bed that my curious toddler found and, to top it off? A CONDOM STUCK IN THE ARMCHAIR!

This is unacceptable and unhygienic on a normal basis but even more so during a worldwide pandemic! Had we not needed to travel we wouldn't have but this was unavoidable. 

Please take the time to get back to me with a resolution. We paid $120.00 for this experience which is uncalled for. Thank you for the reply as the hotel manager/owner have not reached out at all.

My husband and I have always enjoyed our stay with Choice hotels but this was truly disappointing. My children were exposed to all of this, which hygiene wise during Covid, is terrifying. I understand the policies in place. It is just a bit disappointing as an individual at said hotel told me because I booked through the Choice website, I have to contact Choice to be given a refund. They have yet to have the manager return my phone calls so it looks like I am stuck. I do appreciate the offer and will be happy to accept, thank you.

Confirmation Number: 
We arrived at around :15 pm on Friday with excitement. We had to travel with our little dog so researching pet friendly locations led us here. The location was just perfect. We got in the elevator and it was almost frightening. Its tiny and noisy and was kinda scary. When we got to our floor it was ok. It looked like a low end hotel from . Our room was also pretty much what we expected except it wasnt clean. There was water all around the air conditioner on the floor, the bathroom was run down and dirty. The tub had remnants of the former guest.... the balcony was ok but the rail was rusted and loose. The coffee in the room was old and the creamer packets were solid. When I opened it the cream was not powder but a solid chunk so I went without. The staff was very unhappy. We never asked for anything or complained about anything because they cannot help that the hotel is so run down.  We did ask for a late checkout so we could explore the island a bit longer but they said due to COVID cleaning requirements, it wasnt possible. I almost laughed out loud. I dont doubt the requirements but I very much doubt that they are being done at this hotel. I have never  sent a complaint like this before but I just felt robbed. Thank you for letting me vent.

"I absolutely love being a choice member.  I banked enough points that my  vacation this spring was under  for hotel bills. Since many of the rooms I paid for with points.  Plus the free upgrade because of my member status is awesome.  

Only ever had one issue and that was with a hotel in Waterloo Iowa.  It was dark smelly and the door didnt shut right. You could see where it had been kicked in.  

Otherwise every other hotel in the choice chain has been great that I have stayed in.

The Cambria in Rapid City SD has been the % best one out of all so far.    Candace Aufrere thats what do not disturb signs are for.  I stayed at a comfort in for a month due to work and never once was housekeeping an issue. If my sign was up they left me alone.

"Worse hotel!!! Choice Hotels Jeremiah I have no idea how to send a private message. I would love to explain my horrible experience at this hotel!! Let me start by saying that when I travel it I always stay at choice hotels. This particular stay was on Saturday June ,  under the name Stephanie Simpson. The desk staff was great during check in. I was traveling with my support animal and even though I don't have to I reserved a pet room. When I entered the room I noticed an odor but was hoping my senses were just being sensitive. I was tired from being on the road all day so by the time I got my stuff moved in the room and the smell didn't go away I was tired so I was just going to deal with it. I do want to say that the bed and bathroom were clean or I would have changed my room immediately. I noticed a man cleaning rooms a few doors down and told him about the smell in the room and asked if he had anything I could spray mainly on the carpet but also on the chair, curtains (which also had burn holes in them) and the wood closet thing smelled like something died in it. He said he was sorry and gave me something so I sprayed the room and took my dog for a walk. The lady in the room next door was complaining about the smell in her room when she heard me talking with the cleaning crew. When I got back the smell was still so bad it made me sick to my stomach. So I decided to take care of it myself. So I drove to Walmart and got a can of extra strength animal oder febreeze and after spraying the room at least  times the smell went away enough to be comfortable in the room. I have stayed in many many pet rooms and I understand they aren't necessarily as nice as non pet rooms. That some people aren't as diligent about making sure their pet doesn't mess up or smell up a hotel room as I am. This room should not have been used until it could have been cleaned properly including shampooing the carpet and the nasty smell removed. We pay more money for a pet room but shouldn't get room of less quality because you travel with a pet. I don't know if it was a lapse in communication between the cleaning staff and the front desk. The cleaning staff was still very busy cleaning rooms in the evening when I arrived. I understand the financial consequences of closing a room but it couldn't be as severe as loosing a long time loyal customer. When I checked out of my room the next morning my intention was to talk to the front desk about my stay. But...after standing and waiting for several minutes waiting for someone to come back to the desk I gave up because I needed to get back on the road for another long travel day. There are less expensive hotels chains but I got tired of staying in crappy hotels just to save money so I started staying at  Choice hotels. I am hoping that I will never come across another hotel with rooms this bad but if I do I will be looking for another chain to give my business to.

"Just spoke with someone claiming to be Byron Kelly of Atlanta on Phar Rd and will be taking my issue to court He is the general manager of the establishment on Phar Rd And he hung up and has refused to pay back the $97.35 refund. I will be calling corporate. And will be calling Shepherds center since I was in need of a hotel while my son was undergoing therapy after being hit by a car. I will make sure shepherd's center knows how their patients family members are treated and will be giving this matter plenty of online publicity. Disgusting behavior by someone who is supposed to be a general manager of one of your hotels. I called at pm tonight and he was disgusting lied and was rude then hung up on me and told me I could get a lawyer and he didn't care to go right ahead. He is a disgrace to your company. I travel with my mother all over the world on many trips and will never set foot in a hotel associated with your brand as long as you have people like Byron Kelly working for you. There was an attempt to call twice to cancel the reservation because of feeling unsafe in the parking lot on Phar Rd in Atlanta due to  people walking through and not lit properly and the phone qas unanswered We have proof with phone records we fully intend to take to court. And all of this disgusting display of behavior over $97? This is the kind of behavior you all tolerate? Absolutely unacceptable. We will be hiring an attorney and will let everyone know know about this rude person and your hotel chain and how it is run. He said he would not refund and we did not try and call and that's fine he will look like an idiot when he has to go to court because we have the time date stamp we called and nobody answered the phone. The reference number is  The minimal amt was $97.35 and rather than refund that the guy I spoke with who claimed to be Byron Kelly was the same guy who has hung up on me now twice. I recorded the last conversation where he constantly interrupted me stating I could hire a lawyer to get our money back which we will if this isn't resolved quickly. I would think a ""general manager"" would be smart enough to know when I say I have phone records that we tried to call and cancel he basically wrote in the letter we didn't call which he is calling me a liar. We called twice with  to  min in between to cancel. The reservation was an emergency due to my son being transferred to Shepherds center for being hit by a car and that's why it wasn't a reservation made hrs in advance. Really curious if who hung up on me twice was actually Byron Kelly on Aug th or is he posing as him because in the letter it states the staff member made him aware. Phone records the night of Aug th of the male I spoke to needs to be addressed who that is. They are a pathetic excuse for hospitality. He hung up on me twice on different days. Definitely same guy. Recognized voice. I was told the hotel was reprimanded by customer service and they would refund our money promptly. I think this guy on Pharr road in Atlanta is mad and is refusing to refund because he's in simplest terms a jerk. My family has a lawyer on retainer and we will be pursuing this in court and there will be plenty of publicity about this situation if this matter is not solved immediately. I've travelled many places all over the world and never been treated so nastily. I do not want credit points. I want his credit card to be refunded.

"Hello!  I'm really hoping you can help me.  I stayed with Comfort Suites in Sioux Falls SD.  When checking into the hotel, I let them know that I had issues changing my reservation on check out date.  I was using a free night on my last night in town.  Upon check out, they informed me I was charged the full amount at check in and I'd get a credit for the change.  She gave me the receipt and didn't think much more. I didn't receive the full credit so I emailed w/o a response.  I then called and talked to Angela who said she was the manager.  I explained I didn't get the full credit, she then informed me that I wouldn't because I booked under a % discount if staying for  nights.  My issue is they didn't tell me that and they should have not given me the receipt with the cost if that was the case.  I did offer to cancel the reservation and rebook at check in but they said no, they would change the date which didn't happen either. If I would have cancelle and rebooked, I'd have paid less and I tried telling her that but she told me what the website tells me on price doesn't concern her.  I told her I had the receipt and was pretty much told it was my prerogative to dispute it with the credit card company which is already been done.  I can't express how disappointing in the customer service and her non caring attitude is a shame  I'd like to pay what my actual receipt says.  Are you able to help?  Thank you...Julie Drake I attached my receipt with all the information listed. Thank you for any help in this. Comfort Suites  S Carolyn Ave
Sioux Falls SD 
Reservation was under me, Julie Drake. Check in date /13-8/16. Account number is . I'm actually really disappointed in this and in the managers response. I take responsibility in not realizing there was a special rate but it's too bad the hotel didn't take responsibility in mentioning that to the customer at check out and actually handing the customer the correct copy of the bill.  It's also disappointing that I was charged $339.39 but if I would have actually cancelled and rebooked for the exact three days I would have paid $312.12...I shouldn't have assumed they hotel to actually honor that either. I took a screen shot of price of I would have as I like to know what I'm being charged without surprises.  I'm sorry to hear that they aren't willing to honor the price the gave me in the bill or the price I works have gotten if I'd have rebooked for the exact same days... The hotel is a business, they are there to make money.","Julie Drake stayed at Comfort Suites in Sioux Falls SD. She was using a free night on her last night in town when she had issues changing my reservation on check out date. When checking into the hotel, they informed me I was charged the full amount at check out and I'd get a credit for the change. She didn't receive the full credit so she emailed w/o a response.",hotel told me didnâât know my account number iââm,"Hello!  I'm really hoping you can help me.

I will think twice before booking another Choice Hotel. Stayed at the Sleep Inn and Suites BWI and when checking in was blindsided with a $100 deposit after already paying for the room online. Rechecked website numerous times and did not see any mention of the required deposit. The $100 deposit was put back on my credit card the day after I checked out. The issue I have is there is no mention on your website or the Sleep Inn's BWI website that a deposit is required. I felt blindsided especially having prepaid for the room online. Thank you for your prompt reply. In the future before making a reservation at a Choice Hotel I will inquiry about required deposits.,The Sleep Inn and Suites BWI was blindsided with a $100 deposit when checking in.

"Not real happy with these folks. 
Only offered King Rooms with showers. If you want a tub youll have to go in a double room and pay extra!  And we are Choice Members. Front desk belligerent. 
Housekeeper saved us. God Bless her. She could tell i was in pain. Just got out of hospital Thursday. Wont be staying here ever again.  When we arrived at Sleep Inn in Meridian - reservations as Choice members - the front desk clerk was aggravated that she had to step away from doing laundry to help check us in after we rang the bell several times.  other couples came in and were waiting with us during that time as well. Not friendly or welcoming at all. Made us feel guilty for showing up. 
After fussing about having to do it all, we were checked in and went to the third floor to our king room. When we opened the door we discovered it had a shower - not a tub/shower combo. There was a housekeeper working the area who heard our conversation that I needed to go back down and get a king room with the tub. I had just gotten out of the hospital  days earlier and needed a hot soak. The housekeeper called down to the front desk to make the exchange for us. The front desk clerk said there was no such thing. That all king rooms only had showers. If I wanted a tub, I would have to pay extra and take a double room. I said Im not paying extra for just getting the tub/shower that I understood came with my reservation. Front desk hung up. Housekeeper was kind enough to call back and tell her we needed some help. By this time Im almost in tears from the pain of standing and waiting downstairs and now upstairs.  That sweet housekeeper would not give up. She called the third time and was able to convince her to let us have a room across the hall from the first one. Then she came into the room with us to make sure everything was sanitized and everything was there and in order- apologizing for the mixup. Front desk lady had no explanations or apology or accommodation. 
I want to commend the strength of my ally the housekeeper. But front desk needs some lessons in customer service and hospitality. 
Chose this property for the good TripAdvisor rating. Thats probably going to change after I register my review. 
Will not be choosing any other Choice properties. Switched over to Wyndham for the rest of our week-long trip. 
Good luck with getting some hospitality staff trained here.","Front desk clerk aggravated that she had to step away from doing laundry to help check us in after we rang the bell several times.

"Surfbreak Oceanfront in VA Beach certain is not living up to this......I have never seen a hotel this dirty. The hallways on every floor look like they havent been vacuumed in years.  There is all sorts of trash and food and cigarette butts on the floors of all the hallways.  Literally disgusting.  We came to our room, which was actually pretty clean, but there were not enough towels, no wash cloths or soap for our hands.  When we asked at the front desk, they said they didnt have any and didnt know when we would get some.  How are we supposed to shower without towels and wash cloths?  Also this is supposed to be a smoke free facility, but there are cigarette butts in the hallways and a strong smell of smoke/marijuana.  Also cigarette butts around the pool. Choice Hotels I have lots of photos. Hi!  Unfortunately nothing has been resolved.  The staff was very unresponsive.  I was not even greeted at the front desk when I came in....the girl just stared at me so I told her I was there to check in.  The room was pretty decent but the rest was absolutely disgusting.  The hallways of every floor were covered in trash and food and cigarette butts. There was an awful smell.  There were the same pieces of trash in the main lobby floor and a pile of sand from the time we checked in til the time we checked out.  It seemed like none of the staff was trained in customer service and did not care at all.  Im honestly surprised this hotel has not been shut down by the health department.

This % off is what they offer to non members and also other places are offering the same price.  So when I called for a reservation with the extra % off for members they said that is % off the price.

Even though they send me emails saying as a member I save % and I have a screenshot where it says members get extra % off but they will not honor it saying the price is already % off!!

"I am hoping to not be screwed by one of your properties but am wrtiting to you to ensure that this doesnt happen.

I was credited back the money the hotel said i would.  I think some of my frustration was with not just providing a deposit but that, i had stayed in a choice property  times over that week...all of them considerably better then this last one that charged me this extra charge. Im a member as well.  Perhaps something could pop up so that we are classified differently and a little more trusting then others that may cause damage.

We are currently at one of your locations in North Carolina. I traveled from Virginia to visit my boyfriend working out of town. The first room we found a spoon in a drawer with drug paraphernalia on it and a bag of trash along with used sheets. We washed our hands and left. We asked to be moved. After the night manager checked it out she moved us. The second room was even worse. Bed sheets piled on both beds and it smelled like a bottle of perfume had been poured out. We then went back to the manager to get a refund and was told we could not because we washed our hands in the first room. This is crazy! With COVID being still being a issue why could we not get a clean room at your establishment??? I will be sharing this if we do not get our refund tonight. Your night manager was every bit of the rudest manager Ive ever come across. We are currently waiting on police to get here to see if they can help us get a refund. Unbelievable i hope yall get shut down Hello Joe. I dont have a confirmation number. That might have been on the deposit slip we have back to Christi the night manager. It was Saturday night into Sunday morning it happened. I think we arrived there about pm and when all was said and done it was about am Sunday morning. I messaged you all right after the incident. Also name on the reservation was Christopher Mullen and Heather Brown This is the hotel We didnt use a card we paid cash. She gave us a refund after two hours of dealing with her attitude.

Theres holes in our sheets and floor is still dirty. Again im very upset and expected more from your hotel even if its this one At one of hotel now. Horrible.

"About  weeks ago my mother sent the following to Corporate HQ of Choice Hotels.  She received a response saying it would be forwarded to the Advanced Support Team.  Unfortunately we have not heard anything since.  Here is the message that was originally sent.  We had reservations for  rooms at the Comfort Inn,  N. Kinser Pike Bloomington, IN   from May th thru May th , the weekend of the Indiana University graduation. The reservations were made May ,  and a check in the amount of $1,653.12 was sent to secure the rooms. 

Unfortunately, the graduation was canceled due to the worldwide Covid Virus Pandemic.  I called to cancel our reservations at the Comfort Inn the day Indiana University canceled graduation due to restrictions imposed by the state of Indiana.

Our original reservation was made with Michael Gebhardt, the general manager at the time.  When I canceled the reservations I spoke with John Green who had replaced Michael Gebhardt, who assured me that I would receive a full refund of my payment but that it could take a few months.

 

 On June , , I received a letter ( see attachment) from Dawn Crawford, the present General Manager who replaced John Green, stating no refunds would be issued, but I would have $1,653.12 credit to be used the Comfort Inn  at  N. Kinser Pike. Upon receipt of this letter I called Ms Crawford who gave me the number for the CCO/owner, Ken Edwards.  I have called Mr. Edwards, who has had our money, plus the money from all the other families who were coming to celebrate graduates for over a year at this point, and left  several messages. I have never received a return call.   

We live in Maryland.  We have no plans to travel to Bloomington at any time.  We are retirees and were coming to Bloomington for our grandaughter's graduation.  The airlines gave us a full refund, as did the restaurants in Bloomington.

We have stayed in Comfort Inns many times when we were traveling.  I have always found the staff to be helpful and knowledgeable, the rooms to be comfortable and clean.

I feel this incident is not only unfair to us, but reflects poorly on the Choice Hotels family, specifically the Bloomington Comfort Inn. 

I hope you can help us resolve this most upsetting situation and let me know when my refund will be sent. I just saw an article in the New York Times about this issue with frachises and how corporate is trying to help at places like Hilton.  I hope you are able to help as well.  Thnak you! Cindy Oser was the name on the reservation. Let me see if I can get you a reservation number. Thank you. The reservation may have been made under Irnest or Irnie Oser.

"Mt Juliet Quality Inn & Suites, absolute worst motel ever stayed at in my life! Dirty, rooms were dirty...I didn't touch anything without a bacterial wipe from my purse it was so bad including elevator buttons and wore my shoes except in bed but if I had a huge zip lock bag or rain coat to slide into bc the sheets were also disgusting. Huge waste if money...am shocked that Choice hotels have such a property in the time of Covid being so filthy. But the front desk clerk at check out smiled, seemed friendly.   As requested, a DM regarding my recent unpleasant stay. See info below. I was sent a survey earlier in the week, routine survey I think, I completed it and earlier today received an email from the property GM to say sorry. I replied to him but the email bounced back as undeliverable though it appeared to be his direct email (first name Amit). I stayed across the street last yr for a family funeral at the Hampton, much more expensive but clean and currently being furloughed due to Covid (Waffle House Corp/CEO's Office), yes...I was being careful about spending and safety but the value for the lower price was not worth it  and typically, in my job...I coordinate events, meetings and travel for my team. I would have been mortified if I had selected a motel that filthy no matter who paid the bill but especially my limited funds having to see family for an emergency and they all cringed when they heard where I stayed. So please clean it up!!!

Thank you for the timely response.

Veronica Chaffin Choice Hotels thank you...I sent a DM with the requested info. Thank you for your concerned response.  Hi Liz - I understand independently operated but assumed a certain standard in order to have the Choice brand connected to the property. Especially during Covid but again, under any circumstances...not clean. I thank you for the offer. That is fine. My complaint was to make Choice aware, not for anything free or comp'd. However, I will accept the points to use for a future stay.

Everything about the stay was good except that none of the guests were wearing masks and none of the employees (when they saw it) did anything about it. I had to tell a lot of people on more than one occasion not to get on the elevator (which was small) with me because of social distancing and the fact that they werent wearing a mask.
I understand people are unreasonably difficult, but if youre going to keep businesses open it needs to be a safe environment. I was very uncomfortable every time I had to leave my room. So no response? Cool, customer service at its finest  Yall gonna respond to the DM or no??",The hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly.

"We were looking for a place to stay for tonight (9/13/20) in Rapid City SD.

When confronted about it she simply displayed a rude attitude about it. They are very rude and don't care whatsoever how they treat people. Go elsewhere. The overcharges on my fathers credit card was made by the manager named Jacky at the Econolodge located in Morehead City NC. It has been about  years now. My entire family used to stay there quite often. We visit the area a lot because I am a commercial fisherman and also film catching certain species with a couple of different television networks. During this particular visit it my  year old daughter and myself and we used my father's credit card which we often do. Once the CC statement came in my father showed me the extra charges on the card. I contacted Jackie at the motel and she said it was because it was reported that either my  year old daughter or myself was smoking in the room. Nobody in my entire family smokes or uses any tobacco products and we never have because of obvious health risks. I pointed that fact out to her and her reply was that it must have been my  year old daughter. We have stayed in the motel several times since this happened. This past week my wife, my daughter, and myself went to get a room there for several days because I had to film a trailer for the upcoming Tuna season. Jackie approached me complaining about an online review I left about my experience  years ago and told me that we wasn't welcome in any of (her) businesses anymore. I reminded her that she is simply a manager and didn't own any of the motels she worked for. Her reply was that the owners was none of my business and far as I'm concerned she was the top of the ladder. Her attitude is horrible. Just look at the online reviews peop have left. We have been staying there for a really long time so I know and have seen how she is and her rudeness. I have actually been thinking of paying for and taking out a newspaper article explaining some of this and possibly even bringing some of it out during filming. The way she has done my father isn't right. The was she denied my family and myself simply because she didn't like my review was not only wrong and rude, but it's discrimination against us. Choice Hotels done. My legal name is Thomas Adkins. My father's name is Joseph Adkins.","The manager named Jacky at Econolodge Crystal Coast stole approximately $400 from the credit card of my elderly, disabled military veteran.

"Terrible customer service Terrible customer service Hi, thanks for responding to my comment. The matter was not resolved... i will write back with more info after my work hour, is it ok? Hi there, so, Im going to explain what happened and why I said that the customer service was terrible.
On September th I did a reservation through Trip.com for the Comfort Inn & Suites Miami International Airport hotel. I was going to stay only for one night before my flight to Brazil, September th, and I knew that my fare was without refunds, but I had no intention to change my plans. September th, :58 AM (EDT) my reservation was confirmed by the Hotel and at :11 AM (EDT) I got and email from LATAM saying that my flight (September th) was canceled. I contacted LATAM and they gave me the option to fly one day before, September th and I accepted. So, at :41 AM (EDT) Ive contacted Trip.com to see if there was anything that they could do to help me with the hotel. A person called Victoria told me that if the hotel accepts, I would be able to cancel my reservation. So she contacted the hotel and at the st contact, she was unable to talk to anyone, on the nd contact after a the hotel putting her on hold, they hang up on her and on her rd try and the manager rejected the refund. After that I tried to contact the hotel several times without success, no one was answering the phone, so, I gave up.
I was very disappointed because of all that, in the middle of a pandemic that a lot of flights are getting canceled and plans are changing outside of our control, I was just trying to get back to my family, had all this cancelation problems and the manager didn't have the good will to help or to give me a chance to cancel my reservation that was confirmed  minutes before my flight was canceled And for what,  dollars? Surely this money would not be missed for him as it did for me.
I have proof of all that So, this is not just someone trying to get some advantage of something Its just something that make you trust or not on a brand.
Thanks for your time and attention. Just texted you guys The name on the reservation is Luiz C Peck Garrido This was the time when I got the confirmation and when I received the email saying that my flight was canceled Also, because of the change, I also have the proof that I had to flight on th and not on the th like it was planned","LATAM canceled my reservation for the Comfort Inn & Suites Miami International Airport hotel on September 8.

Member number is TXC01938 Thank for ur help. I appreciate ur time. ?! Thanks for ur help once agian Did u get all the info. I do have further concerns I stayed last night at a hotel in Nashville tn and they were not wearing masks and had some housekeeper came to my door serval times this morning and knocked after I had a late check out and I told them I have a late check out....... they just came serval times. And bothered me. Thats inconvenient, and why are they not wearing mask and allowing people to go get breakfast with no face mask and not sanitiary at breakafast so I might have the virus now due to them, They allow unsatiaty breakfast area and no mask at check in theyre allowing that. And allowing me late check out but housekeepers keeping banging on my door before  which is check out Tiffany Chan cheacj in October  dt. And check out second yea no mask nothing I may have gotten the virus workers no mask sneezing into theyre hands etc. breakfast we do not them really bad. I lost my points on them and its scary me and my daughter are pro infected now. Im very upset And worried. I cant get my ,000 points back. Its just sad they aint taking precautions I mean its upsetting Now my daughter has been freaking out thinking she will get it cause she understand About the mask. Least someone could do is act like they care but the hotel didnt. I spent ,000 points and disappointed. I just think my daughter is scared now and is freaking out. Because of them no mask and shes thinking we got it. I just feel like no one did nothing at the hotel and its not fair to my child or me during the pandemic I hope that youll can help.  Had a issue with a stay trying to get my points back. .i appreciate youll trying to help. Sleep inn Gallatin tn. Yea thanks cause Im very upset about what happened. I spent ,000 of my points on it. Plus I got my daughter scared cause no one wore mask the front desk at breakfast or the housekeeper and this is the workers.  confirmation number. And its sad were in a pandemic and theyre doing that its very unsafe how theyre doing. Yea I really would like my points back or something. Cause my daughter has been scared since I left and yes Im a member since July with youll and been loyal I go to lots of hotels and plan on that too in the future but Im very disappointed in what happened with no mask for none of the employees not good My daughter is upset too so thats why I said that. Its only fair to me and my child. My daughter is  and upset cause she even knows to wear the mask. But they all didnt desk or at breakfast or housekeepers its unreal I just dont think thats fair to my child and its scared her. Its unsafe. I did contact the hotel they said nothing to me.... so I completed the stay and had issues. And not to mention the housekeepers arguing in the halls. I just think someone should offer me something some kind of points back. Only fair. None of the employees wore mask. I just prefer something back. I did contact the hotel they dont seem to care Its just wrong no one wore mask.... not at desk or breakfast or housekeepers. None but me and my daughter has to wear it. For the safety. I keep calling them and they dont care to do nothing not even the manager will talk to me there. The employees are awful.  wow. Well the hotel wont do nothin*for me. They wont even allow me to talk to a manager thats how bad this stay is. The worst Well Ive called them several times a and they wont call me back nor let me speak to a manger its why I came to youll and hoping I can get something back. This is sad. I talked to the hotel they said they cant access to give me my points back that u would have to call them so I can get my points back I just talked to them So they said if you call them I can get my points back I just spoke with them. They said youll can call or something and I can get my points back cause they couldnt do it on theyre end. I would appreciate if youll can fix it. Well they just told me to have youll call them. Ive been having a issue gettin into touch with him hes never there And thats what she said when I talked to her just a few ago. She said that youll can call them. Theyre manager is never available to talk I just got thru to them todsy. And they said that Well when will u talk to him cause I couldnt get ahold of him myself. Its unfair to me. Cause I spoke with th lady that said she talked to manger It took me forever to get ahold of him so I doubt hes going to call youll back n This isnt fair at all Same thing they told me but they never allow the manger to speak to;me. Its bull. Its not right. Its like a game that hotel has been playing all week....... not right at all That is why Im going thru youll. And youll still wont help me Least the other hotels will answer u and let u talk to theyre manager this wont Well the hotel manger isnt and wont respond nor answer youl, or me so I just want some thing back anything to be offered to me its not fair. But the hotel wont ever let me personally talk to the manger so its not right. So how could u ever get the points back..... if u cant talk to him since he never answers or they wont let me talk to him hows that fair? I just feel like I had a serious issue with the hotel if they dont fix it youll should help me offer me something. I think thats fair to me. Wow. Just wow. Thats not right nor u or the hotel has helped Thanks",Tiffany Chan cheacj was staying at Comfort in mason Ohio when she lost her points on them.

I need the email to corporate for your Beaumont location Yall the hotel in Beaumont cant fix a tv. Ive been in this room for a week no tv and management hasnt done shit to fix it. Dont do it  Do not come to the Beaumont location! I havent had a working tv in a week! Front desk doesnt do after hours assistance. This shit sucks ass! Hello,

I checked into your hotel Monday, and noticed the tv didnt work. I alerted the front desk. They sent maintenance there. Maintenance didnt fix it nor did he let me know he couldnt fix it so I went from Monday til Monday without a working tv. All while being told maintenance came by but he couldnt fix it. I know it may seem like something trivial, but when you check into a weekly hotel you expect to be able to come in, shower, lay down and watch tv. I didnt get the problem fixed until Monday the last day of this reservation even though I extended it for another week. At that point I was moved to the other room. Management said there wasnt anything she could do for the inconvenience and I dont feel thats right at all. Id like somebody to address this if possible. You dont rent out rooms to guests without a working television and nobody at least keeping you updated about it I have to find my choice privileges number but Ill take it thank you Is there any way I can get points for my future stays?

"Hello. We recently booked a -night stay at Westport, MO (MO608) for our daughters wedding. We paid $442.62 for the entire stay and are requesting a partial refund.

We had this booked before the COVID pandemic, so the rate wasnt unreasonable, considering we thought we would be able to swim, eat hot breakfast, etc. 

What we received was a musty-smelling room, a toilet that barely flushed, stained comforter, lukewarm shower water, and no amenities.
We also noticed the room rates advertised on the WiFi announcement were $30 less per night. 

We asked the front desk about adjusting the rates, and they stated they couldnt do anything about it. 

Please help!

Confirmation#  
My wifes Choice Membership# JAN07194 Sent you a PM this morning and am patiently awaiting a response... Jendy, 
The price difference alone between our stay and what the rates should have been was $129.60. 
That price difference doesnt include the dissatisfaction resulting from the above concerns. 
We appreciate your offer, but we dont feel that it fully compensates us for the price difference, grievances, and lack of on site customer service. 
Were very reasonable people, but we firmly believe there should be more compensation than a partial nights stay. 

Please advise.

Thank you,

"Watch the one in Meridian Mississippi.  I stopped for a room yesterday hurricane evacuee at that. I ask her if they was pet friendly like most comfort inns are. She told me know and then she told me it would cost me  dollars for my pet to stay. I felt discriminated against cause I am white she was black and very rude. I was not familiar with Mississippi as it was. But my  year old mini schnauzer that dont weigh  pounds is well behaved like the schnauzers are house trained and is like my kid, being I am older person and kids are grown. I was not very pleased with that comfort inn hotel.  I was working my way back home after hurricane delta. I stopped in your meridan comfort inn, next door to sams club basically. i had called and reserved a room on my way to there. lady at the front desk was very rude. i thought well maybe its just me, I am tired and this is the second hurricane I have had to leave my home and my routine for in less than two months. I went in to get room and I asked the lady was you all pet friendly. I stay at Jasper Al. comfort inn all the time and they are very pet friendly. My baby is  years old house trained the works,he is mine and my husbands kid since our kids are grown and we are older with health problems. Anyway the lady told me  no, then she turned around and told me a  dollar fee. I polietly told this rude lady we wouldnt be staying there. you can see the cancellation in my account. Then after she told me it was  fee. I told my husband this lady was rude, first she told me no then she told me .00 fee. I told him I wondered if it was cause I was white and she was black. I have never in my life felt discrimaneted against til I walked into your comfort inn there in Meridan Ms. I came on to Louisiana couldnt find a room then call electric compant for them to tell me they didnt know when our electric would be on. I am not suppose to travel for long hours due to my heart and a pulmonary embolism, but I turned aroiund and went all the way back to Jasper Al.

"Hi, thank you for reaching out. The booking number is  . Teri was absolutely wonderful to work with and went above and beyond.  One thing I need to address is two erroneous charges.  A few hours after we checked out we saw a charge for $163.88.  We called the hotel and were told that it was for missing items from the room, specifically two pillows.  I advised the staff member that I spoke with that we didnt remove anything from the room. She placed me on hold and checked with housekeeping, when she came back to the call she apologized for the mistake and said that it was a misunderstanding. She said that the money would be immediately refunded. On or around /14 our account was charged again in the amount of $163.88. I spoke with the manager Bob who apologized for the mistaken charge and said that he would be refunding both charges.  I called again today because the charges were still on our account. Bob advised that the refunds were processed on /14 and it would take -10 business days to go through.  I am sure to choice hotels $327.76 isnt a lot of money but this creates major issues for us.  It is interfering with paying bills, getting groceries, etc., and frankly completely unacceptable that we should be made to wait -10 business days for not one but two mistakes we didnt make.  The lack of urgency in this matter and honestly the minimally apologetic nature is disgusting.  Im not expecting grand gestures, but something more than just an oopsie daisy attitude would make this a little better.  I would like to hear from a member of corporate, not Bob at the hotel to get this matter resolved sooner rather than later.  I can be reached at  (443) -3718.

Lovely lack of service when they promise platinum and diamond members a dedicated customer service rep.  Choice Hotels I've done that  times. The last email I recieved said I'd have the point today or tomorrow (for a stay in Aug) but no mention of credit for the nights.......  Account number tdn1016, stayed in secrets Capri Playa Del Carmen, Aug -aug . Booked direct after contacting the platinum member reservation people and they said to book direct. Received an email on Oct . Still no points or credit for the nights. I'm at the point if this doesn't get credited, I'm switching to a different brand. It's been over  months.
Dear Tim.

 

We appreciate that you took the time to bring these matters to our attention, and we are truly sorry we have not met your expectations. Kindly note that points for these type of hotels can take much longer to post to your Choice Privileges account since they use a totally different system from us and from the rest of Choice Hotels properties. 

 

Note as well that I have sent this information to our Coordinators team for assistance and points will post to your account within the next -10 business days.

 

Thank you for your loyalty and Elite Platinum membership with the Choice Privileges rewards program.

Email Resolution Desk All that info is attached to my account. Seems more like a phishing scam then choice Hotels, Still no resolution and customer service won't return my emails. 
  South  east spanish fork UT  I will be filing a compliant with the attorney generals Utah depart of consumer protection next week, followed by the BBB and every complaint site I can find. This is ridiculous. I have  recordings of me calling choice and being told to book directly through the hotel and that I would receive credit. That's the Only reason we stayed at this hotel. Every single hotel I have ever booked with choice has been directly through the hotel. Yet this one time it doesn't count?  points is a joke compared to  nights worth of points and stay credits. I will make sure everyone I know never stays in another choice hotel. Wyndham will be thrilled to get my companies full business. Jendy, while appreciate the help the only reason I stayed at this property was to get the stay credit. I should hit diamond this year but won't without this stay credit-it was  days. Obviously just bumping me to diamond would solve my issue but I'm not asking for that, just the nights that I should have credit for. Attached are the recordings from the call with choice saying if I booked direct I would still get the credit and below is copied the email from secrets Verifying they complied with all requirements for me to get credit.

Hey Tim,

 

I have submitted everything that I am required to for Choice Rewards. I was advised it will most likely show on your account post travel due to the recent abundance of cancellations; they want to make sure you travel before giving you any points.

 

If you have any questions as to why it is not showing on your upcoming trips, I would try to reach out to Choice.

"My mother initially reserved a room at the Aurora Denver Airport location on the ground floor as she has a bad back and hip, making it difficult to do stairs or walk far.

"I still have not received my refund nor heard from anyone at the Miami hotel... I am trying to give you the benefit of the doubt but I did contact my credit card and they said there is no evidence of anyone trying to do my refund ever.  And that was October nd.  It's now Nov  and I still do not have it. I just phoned the hotel again (long distance $ from Canada) and the lady at the counter said the DM was gone for the day but she was printing my information out to give them tomorrow morning when they return.  I just want my $ back already.  I cancelled this back on August ,  and it's been more than enough time.  I've not disputed it with my bank because I don't think that's the way to do anything. Thank you Numas. I still havent heard back from the hotel. Omg that isnt true.  Reservations may be changed or cancelled WITHOUT A CHARGE! I had until the day before to cancel I will NOT accept that they will no refund me. This is horrible business practice. So go back and ready your messages to me from before. when they told you they already tried to refund me but it didnt work!!!!! They lied about that. And now they are lying saying Im not eligible for a refund. Give me my damn money back! I cancelled  months ago and Ive had to call x and use Twitter. You realize they lead me on about my refund until it was past the  mark to despite the charge with my cc! Im livid.  Im not going away until I get my money back. Trust. Im NOT going down without a fight    I cancelled a res for Feb back in August. Im STILL trying to get my refund. On Oct  they said they had tried to do a refund but it didnt work. NOW they are saying I cant get a refund! WTAF!? This is from my booking email. So youre going to need to escalate this.   this is from my booking email! First the hotel lied to you and said they tried to do the refund on Oct  and now they say I booked a non refundable fare! Bullshit. Give me my money back! #refund #hotel #choicehotel #miami I want a phone number for someone higher than the DM of the hotel. Because someone has to  this. There is NO WHERE in my email that says it was a special rate and non refundable. My booking email does it say its a special nonrefundable rate. In fact when I go to the website for the #comfortsuitesmiamiairport I can find the same fare I booked. And it says the same thing. Fully refundable as long as its cancelled  hours before the checkin!  There has to be someone the people at the hotel have to answer to. And I want that persons information so I can contact them. Because the people at the hotel are straight up lying. Why did they tell you on oct  that they tried to do the refund and THEN change their story a few weeks later to Im not eligible for a refund!?   Im waiting. I really appreciate your help. Please know I wasnt angry with you. Just frustrated. I will be in touch if it doesnt come in.  Thank you.  Replied.

"Finally get to the hotel after a long day, look forward to sleeping in, walk down the long hall to the elevator and see this...no word about construction on the app where I made my res. Not fair  I was the one that posted about my experience at your Willow Spring, MO property. My Choice Reward number is MRD6567 and I'm Diamond with you. There's no indication anywhere that the hotel is under construction. Even when I checked in, it was never mentioned. It wasn't until I saw this sign. The guys were on the roof by am and housekeeping knocked on my door (even with Do Not Disturb) at am. It was a short stay but what concerns me is there should be notes to indicate things at the property that impact the guest experience. I've always paid attention and choose hotels by location, then amenities, then price. I could have chosen a different property, even a Choice property, had there been a note on the app when I made the res.  It just makes me have to double check now when making reservations. Thanks for your attention. Cheers. Michelle  is email; MRD6567 is member ID, address is my PO BOX  Waterloo, IL name is Michelle Donath I didn't see anything deposited into my Choice Privileges account yet.

"I complained about one of your hotels and you asked for a private message.

I stayed at a suburban extended stay in Grand Island Nebraska. That was the first one I stayed at. It was clean and comfortable. That is why I chose the same hotel when I came to the Denver area. After publicly making my complaint, I asked some friends in the area. It turns out I just picked the wrong part of town. It's hard to be honest without coming off as rude, but I will do my best. Judging by the clientele, what I have is what I should expect. The staff has been very nice, but they also fit into their surroundings. The rooms seem updated and look nice. The kitchens aren't stocked but I am guessing that stuff walks out frequently.The towels and sheets are pretty gross. I bought new bedding and towels. I'm comfortable.  The price was good and I should expect that there was a trade off. I really don't want to see the staff take any heat. It appears, as I observe more, that they are quality people doing the best with what they are going to have to work with.

"I used to work at a Choice Hotel, Quality Inn in Cadiz, KY owned by Ram Kabir. Not going into too many details, the hotel was in shambles. The pool had not been in operation for years, and the owners filled it up and made people sign a paper that said if they were to get sick, that they wouldn't sue the hotel, because the pool was never treated with chems or inspected by the health department. The owners repeatedly ripped me and another employee off for overtime. They had down that I was tax exempt and I had to pay the IRS back money THEY weren't paying into my taxes.

Thank you for the prompt response, Chris! Please know that by no means, we are taking sides on this matter; we work with the information that the hotel provides us; as each property is operated individually, we don't have control over their policies or procedures. It's important to mention that all properties manage their billing system, so Choice Hotels does not collect payments from any reservations. After checking this information with Frida (General Manager), she confirmed that you stayed from /13/20 through /20/20; for that reason, they are not applying any refund to your credit card. I have forwarded your feedback to the hotel owner to make a review of what they need to improve moving forward.

I stayed at the Clarion Inn & Suites Central I-44 in Tulsa Oklahoma Sunday night  Nov .  I paid over  dollars for a ""Military Discounted"" room.  I have traveled the world and stayed in hundreds of hotels and I never been in something as bad as this hotel.  For starts I found a very small dead bug on one of the beds.  So I was forced to sleep in my clothes in fear of bedbugs.  Second the room had been smoked in and the smell was extremely strong.  I smoked for  years so I was able to get past the smell, but I am sure most people would be able to.  All of the electrical items in the room were unplugged so I had to move furniture just to get the TV to work.  The toilet paper was positioned so close to the toilet that you could not even sit without knocking off the roller.  All the caulking in the shower had been removed and there was a very large amount of black mold visible.  The curtain had been ripped off the hangers so I had to use a chair to hold the curtain in place to keep it closed.  Add in broken furniture, broken tile and the overall poor quality of everything in this room I assure you that I will never stay in any of your hotels from this point on.  I think I would have been better off sleeping in my car than staying in your hotel.

"Hi there. I recently completed a stay at the Quality Inn Conference Center at Citrus Hills in Hernando, FL. I thought you should know that that property does not take COVID seriously and is putting the safety of their staff and guests at risk. Staff at the front desk rarely wore masks, including when interacting with guests. Even worse, I saw on multiple occasions and on multiple days a housekeeper cleaning guest rooms without a mask. Finally, the hand sanitizer dispensers by the elevator were always empty, indicative of the blas attitude the hotel took to COVID-related safety precautions. I booked that hotel because I believed you guys required masks in your hotels: There were less expensive hotels that were closer to the attractions we wanted to see but I booked a Choice Hotels property because I believed you guys took proper COVID precautions.

In addition to a cigarette smell in the room. I asked for another room and it was much better compared, but still horrible as you saw in the pictures. My wife and I had already wiped the room down with some Lysol and had no confidence in getting put in a rd room. Instead we went to the front desk and asked for a clean set of sheets and towels and made the bed ourselves. In addition to the bed sheets not being clean, the headboards were sticky, the water pressure would turn completely off for periods a time, the floors were not vacuumed well, tons of dust clumps, there were two nasty used socks under the chair and although very nice...none of the employees were wearing masks which was uncomfortable.

Never staying at quality inn and suites again So this past weekend was my birthday weekend and my best friend took me to salem Massachusetts to celebrate. When we got to the quality inn and suites in Lexington where she had reserved the rooms and she had already paid for the rooms we were told the rooms were never paid for and we had to pay at the desk. So I pulled out my card and paid for it even though her account was showing that the money had been taken out so I paid for both rooms and the deposits. I asked the clerk if the card would be charged that day or did I have to worry about them doing a hold and then my account getting weird because i have experienced this before. He said no that the money came off of my card right then and there and all I had to look out for was the return of my deposit. Well I checked my account this morning and all of my money was gone. They hit my card again and I have the pictures showing they charged my card days ago. Now tomorrow is thanksgiving and my family doesnt get to enjoy a turkey dinner because my account was hit again and all of the money is gone. After I specifically asked if this would happen and I was told no. My family is devastated. I always cook for the holidays and this year there will be nothing. I dont appreciate being lied to and this happening this close to the holiday is horrible. My birthday is totally ruined. This was for the one reservation. My friend made the reservations in her name but only hers was saved and j had to just get a room when we got there. It was completely insane. We had two rooms that joined together It was room  and  My member I'd is nhd4580 my phone number is    and my mailing address is  ridgeway road lot  toms river nj .

" Hi there, Im a long term resident at a WoodSpring Suites location in Quantico, Virginia over  months in total. I liked staying here so much I moved in. Im room . Ive contacted the front desk and let them know about a resident directly below me who keeps ... pestering me by knocking on the roof with what I can only think is a broom. Its  PM on thanksgiving at the moment and whenever I even move the trash can, get in bed, sit in the chair, move the computer chair, open the refrigerator door or use the bathroom he starts ... banging on the roof as if Im being too loud for him. Im a single man just doing ordinary things. He even had front desk call me about a noise complaint at  PM today after simply getting in my bed. Im also a shareholder in your company because I like this place. Please ... take care of this. All times of the day hes knocking on his roof, my floor being nuisance. I could go as far to say maybe he is handicapped? Something needs to be done about it and I choose my room based on its location in the building so I will not entertain the idea of ... switching rooms. Ive let a front desk receptionist by the name of Katrina all ready know about the nuisance last week and yet he keeps on banging the roof and calling the front desk. Its  for crying out loud & I cant open the refrigerator door, get in bed or sit in the ... computer chair without this person banging on the roof or calling the front desk. Im pretty well known with the crew Joey, April, Katrina and Eric and can vouch for my character. Please do something about this as soon as possible. Its absolutely inexcusable harassment.  please check your DMs Ive sent you an urgent matter. Thanks! Thats not good enough for me. Your actually requesting someone that has been a customer for a year to move into another room rather then deal with someone who is banging on the hotel roof for no reason?    They didnt teach you customer service in school did they. Your boss will be hearing from me. Liz, 

Im a city dweller who liked the place so much I ended up moving in and just kept paying weekly. Ive been here sense last Christmas with only  weeks of a vacation in the middle. Front desk has been contacted as well as the General Manager. They were suppose to take care of it yesterday and yet again I woke this morning at  to use the restroom and crawled back into bed and the man started banging on the roof/ wall again as to tell me I was being too loud. Im even brought to say maybe the man below is handicapped. This is my permanent address. Im not up at the end of the week.       Im quite settled in and have been for going on  months (-) two weeks during a work trip to Louisville, Ky. I dont plan on moving. This may be a hotel to you but where I come from its a full fledged suite studio apartment with security all utilities included and I have a right to do everyday normal living activities without an absurd guest banging on the roof/ my floor at all hours of the day including PM having the front desk harass me for changing the trash and sitting the trash can back on the floor and moving the computer chair out far enough so I can sit in it. The correct action for customer service isnt to move to another room it should involve the mentally ill being put on the top floor or out of the establishment. Dont get me wrong Liz , the staff and general manager here are a fantastic group of people and Im not doubting their abilities to run the establishment properly according to your franchise agreement, just the first response came after I finally was in touch with the general manager and didnt agree with the way it was handled. Who ever stays in the room I am in will receive the same treatment from the gentleman downstairs and its not logical to just move me so we can continue to have the same issues I say we because i care about your company and its extensions as well. If your franchises do well it makes you look well and my stock price goes up. Ive been in management,  retail,  and customer service for over  years. This is coming from someone with massive amounts of experience not just a disturbed customer who books a room every now and then. Yes I know thats how a franchise works , I used to help open them, but the franchise directly makes your company, the company who sells out the franchise  have an image good or bad. I had no idea who choice hotels was but because I had such a great experience at Wood Spring Suites it made me want to learn more about it and it led me to you and Sandpiper and it led me to buying shares of your company which is investments and more money for the CEO , more money and bonuses to give out to its staff like you Liz. Creates more expansions for growing with the company as well all because I had a good stay at a franchise you sold rights too.  Maybe you should approach your business model a little different and become more involved in the contracts you create and more involved in the companies daily affair. Most franchise contracts or hotels sold still require the new owner to uphold standards. And lets be clear Its not about having a quiet place to rest after work. Its about the nuisance. I could care less if these people play music, have a party or tap dance in clogs above me but what I wont have is front desk calling me or having my floor knocked from underneath for simply sitting in a chair, taking a shower or laying in bed. Like I said before, the general manager knows and I woke up to pounding on my floor still. Have a good night.","Liz, a long term resident at a WoodSpring Suites location in Quantico, Virginia.

"Comfort Inn in Turlock CA is a perfect location if you dont want to be bothered with feeling secure. Im honestly still in shock that it cost me nearly $900 to stay with my family in this hotel. My husband joked that it seemed like they werent bothering to put any money back into the location and were waiting for it to just burn to the ground and rebuild. Our security latch was flimsy from being reconstructed from what I can only assume was kicked in on several occasions. Our shower curtain was torn all along the top, the linens were thread bare, our comforters had rips and holes, rusted bathroom light fixtures, peeling wallpaper and chipping paint, holes in the curtains, stuffing coming out of the couch cushion and springs poking into my sons back from the sofa sleeper mattress. The security card swiper to get into the hotel was broken so any bum off the street had access into the building. The elevator control panel was broken with visible wires and the door handle to the stairs was completely gone, they were using some wire to hold it open. If I could post the pictures I absolutely would, feel free to message me through FB if your planning to stay there and see whats waiting for you. There are definitely much better and SAFER places to stay for the same price or cheaper. Hi Grettel, I appreciate your apology. Normally I do not write reviews unless they are positive but in this situation I felt completely duped considering the rating the hotel had on booking.com. Here is a screen shot with the information you requested and the reservation was under my name, Kristin Freeman. We also paid the additional pet fee of $120. Chuck Schaaf thats super disappointing to hear, I was kind of leery on their response. I agree it is an insult considering what we paid. My husbands response was why the hell would we want to stay in one of their hotels again!?. Im sorry you had a bad experience too. Apparently its a franchise thing but if thats the case there should be standards.",The Comfort Inn in Turlock CA is a perfect location if you dont want to be bothered with feeling secure.

"Be fully aware of these promotions. They offer such sweet deals, but with a lot of red tape.
I booked for the Thanksgiving holiday, as I have for the past ten years. Same city, same hotel... originally my bank account was debited over $400 for a stay that started on Sunday, even though I did not arrive in this town until Tuesday. Thankfully desk clerk resolved & returned the money to my account. 
I then paid for  nights, but didn't qualify for the ""stay + nights get  points""  points promo. 
Decided to extend my stay for  more nights......couldnt do that, had to break it up into  stays, I'm sure to prevent another points promo ""Stay  nights  points"", and could not book the extended  days into one, promo ""stay  nights for % off,. Had to book each night individually. And no one in Customer Service could solve the problem/issue. Just a lot of foreign language apologies. Ridiculous customer service solutions & promo programs. 
And I am a ""Diamond Member"". What a joke. Choice Hotels will do Good morning to respondents Numas  &  Liz. This is Anita Mae Johnson (Perry), member # AXP21240, been a,member since . This message is in response to my Facebook comment. 
Attached you will see what it is I'm talking about. Keeping in mind that #1- I live almost  miles from Nampa, Idaho; #2- I have been staying at this particular hotel for over ten years,  several times per year, #3- I am supposedly a ""Diamond"" Member which obviously means nothing in loyalty. 
And the topper on this particular episode, was that I had called on Monday morning before my arrival, to let Daisy know that I would be there the following day, Tuesday  /24. She told me they had me checked in, and I stated that was impossible as I was still at home working. She said she would fix it. 
I arrived on Tuesday /24 to check in, no reservation was on record for me, but fortunately Michelle had a room left for me, I checked in, swiped my card for  daybstsy @ $185.22. All was well. Until the following day when I noticed that my bank had been debited for $426 from Sleep Inn in Nampa! This was very upsetting, I contacted my bank & Michelle, and the money was returned to my account that day via my bank. 
I then decided to stay extra nights, because sometimes plans change,  (my children live all around the area & waiting to see who can spend time with mother is never guaranteed. ) Therefore I paid another $82.08 for Friday /27, because I could not extend my stay at the rate I checked in with, and same thing for Saturday /28 for another $82.08  All was well, I checked out Sunday /29 & headed home. When Monday came around I noticed the $426 charge had been debited to my account again, and credited back only $357. 
I contacted my bank as to how this is happening. She stayed that the merchant... Sleep Inn, kept denoting my account and she wanted to talk to the merchant. They would not talk to her.
These are the things that frustrated me with  not only the promotion play, but that money was taken from my bank account, on a cancelled card, without my authorization, and in was charged for a ""no-show"" when I had called to say I would be there /24. Choice Hotels 
As requested, I sent you a pm. No response. Not even read. I can share all the info here on your main page if you like.  Shay DaBaby 
Evidently  I fell for the same ""send us a pm"" b.s.. 
They never even read it.  Choice Hotels 
Thank you Liz for your response, not blowing me off, and not sending a computer generated apology. 
Have a safe, enjoyable, and Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays. Still no response Still no resolution. Choice Hotels good morning ""Liz"" & ""Numas"". I sent the requested information, along with copies of invoices. No one as of this date, has even looked at them.  It appears I am not the only disgruntled customer. And yet NOTHING has been done to resolve the issue.  This merchant debited my bank account, with an old card number to the tune of $426. Hello Liz. Then, as a representative of ""Choice Hotels"", and their ""Choice Privelages"" program, you surely can explain to me as to why I did not receive the extra ,000 Bonus points for staying three plus nights in a row? And why I did not receive the Extra ,000 Bonus Points for staying + nights?  This week was broken up into  different stays. One  night stay, one  night no show charge, and two additional night stays. Thank you Liz, I appreciate your professional courtesy, and ypur prompt attention to this matter. Have a Merry Christmas my friend.

Can someone please pass along I love what Pat, you, the entire staff, and organization are doing during the pandemic. I love the company structure and the community I work with too. I have a lot of insight into the hotel community in General. Go figure this would be the last one I would end up joining the membership program to. I look forward to watching the company grow and evolve. Appreciate all the training and hope there will be opportunities to advance within the company as I finish up my education. I have elite status at several other hotel chains and spent the better part of k attempting to create a business through the Marriott chain. I may no know everything but that is my view of life in general. Constant learning. I am just saying I know what makes the other chains special to me and why I would still choose to stay with them from time to time. To match what they have created may not be possible but to solidify this company as the third best and first when it comes to a starting place for those entering into the hospitality industry you are well on your way. Here is one free suggestion (the rest I want a consultation fee- kidding well partially maybe a donation to charity : ) They say location, location, location. Which the Marriott and Hyatt have the cities covered. Even some resort locations but there are what I will call mid-remote  locations that are part of what one of my coworkers just said she was in school for- outdoor tourism and travel that would be easy to acquisition. Bonderant, Alpine, Thermopolis Wyoming here in this state. Places like Rifle, Sagwatche, and the western slope in colorado, but what would I know I am just a dog. Sorry about the spelling. Do you have a fetch it and light up ball btw. They are the best christmas gift for a dog. nice decoration... I like the color Wait gray said thats a terrible idea. Besides who you gonna get to manage it? The people there are not very welcoming if your not from Wyoming and it snows a lot. Besides who is gonna want to travel to a destination thats remote, away from people, and in a beautiful location.","Steven Gray has been working for the Comfort Inn and Suites in Laramie, Wyoming.

The bed frame was finally fixed today but it took way too much effort on my part as a guest for that to happen so late. Nor should we have had to transfer rooms as many times as we did all with problems and no assistance. Its like nobody cares at that hotel!! Quite a disgrace if you ask me They have not made it up to us. We are only still here because your corporate told us to stay here while they decided on a refund or credit. Also we have no where else to go. I dont have a ton of extra money to keep booking different hotels! None of this should have ever happened and when it did it should have been addressed immediately not  -  hrs later. The manager has not contacted us at all. Nor the regional mgr. they did eventually fix the broken bed yesterday after  nights of sleeping on the floor but I am still very unhappy with everything that transpired the first  hours of our stay here! There has been no apology or resolution or reimbursement or credit. We are checking out tomorrow I have since checked out and the hotel mgr did not rectify the situation let alone even acknowledge any issues or apologize! No i want a refund.

"Is it possible to discuss some of the bad experiences I've had at your hotels this week? I understand its a pandemic and we all should expect things to be imperfect. However it seems many people are using the situation as an excuse for unacceptable service. I was promised a hot meal and the Comfort Inn in Yulee provided no coffee or any food other than individually wrapped cold muffins. All I asked for in return was a credit to my easily researchable account. I WAS  a regular customer. A loyal customer. Then in Savannah, the Quality Inn there was unapologetic after there were no towels in my room. I'm not sure what its about, in the hectic day and age just about anything can trigger an attack or passive aggressive antagonism. But I'd like to ask youre management team whether that situation is acceptable to them, especially since I am not planning to visit Choice Hotels ever again at this point. Thank you in advance for your reply.
 Respectfully, Dan Dixon Great, but what will you do for me? I'm registered on that enough? I have downloaded the receipts, where can I send them? It looks like they put a $30 charge for my room in Savannah too. I didn't even take a shower there so I'm not sure why. Is this just a joke? So obviously this means you don't care. I guess I'll go higher up the chain. And really, $30, for what? Just need to know where to send the receipts. You suck. Why would you make a lifelong unhappy customer? Confusing stuff.

"Why are you not able to give a refund when I stayed at a clarion? I have filed a legal claim and now and being pushed to the side since July of this year!! Joe, I arrived on July rd for a one night stay in a jacuzzi suite. I normally travel to your other locations throughout the summer but due to covid I choose to stay in my hometown of Evansville, IN. I should have left town or booked a different hotel because this stay was my worst nightmare! I checked in and was told there would be no breakfast as was promised when I made the reservation(during covid). I was willing to look past it because Im understanding. After getting settled in I went to the pool. As I stepped on the ladder in the deep end the entire thing collapsed on me caused me to hit my knee on the side of the pool, scrap my leg and fall all the way to the bottom. I was unable to get help so my friend went to the front desk and got someone. He told me there was nothing he could do. After waiting a few moments and with the help of my friend I made it back to my room. I called the customer complaint line and they told me this was a legal complaint and gave the the complaint number . They then told me I would have to speak with the manager about a refund if I was unable to speak with someone to give them a call back in the morning. The manager was not working that night and told me to ask for her in the morning. When I checked out they told me the manager was not on site and they would take my name and number. I waited two days before calling the hotel and then the hotline. I have been getting the run around since-since JULY!! I have been calling the hotel only to hear the manager is not in.

I have talked to an attorney who will take my case but Im trying everything I can do to not involve him. I will include screenshots of my reservation. I also have pictures of the broken ladder and my injuries. I hope you understand I have exhausted all my efforts on this case and my next step will be an attorney or going public with this matter until I receive a refund and compensation for this. Thank you for your time Joe.","Joe has filed a legal complaint and is being pushed to the side since July. He was staying at a clarion in Evansville, Indiana when he got into trouble.

"Arrived a little while ago. Reviews must not be real. Floors are so sticky (literally, in the room's entryway and the bathroom). Notepad greasy. Both mirrors smeared and dirty. Didn't make it FEEL very clean, especially with the huge roach on the wall. But they say the remote is clean! Unfortunately the cardboard holder the remote is sitting in is very sticky, and dirty. I can't say we feel comfortable staying here in the midst of a pandemic. I don't believe that they are cleaning to the level they say they are. This was a mistake. This is to Joe who responded to my post on the feed. The reservation is in the name of Dan Tulloh. We are members, though I don't have any of that information with me. We checked in yesterday /4 and sadly we're here till tomorrow. If I hadn't have made an uncancelable reservation we'd have been out of here last night. Clearly I made an error in my reservation. Last year we stayed about a quarter mile away at the Sleep Inn and it was just fine. When I made this reservation I thought I was making it at the same place.

The clerk was thoroughly and difficult to understand and not helpful at all last night. I made a list of what's bad and what's good and I'm going to see if I can attach it here.

Thank you for the opportunity to say something. I don't even walk  in my bare feet here. I wore shoes to the bathroom and hate to touch anything.

Thank you. I think for $10 or less per night we could have stayed at that Sleep Inn that was very nice last year and I would have gladly paying it last night.

Oh, and we have a non-smoking room but you can smell cigarette smoke all the way to the door. Last night it started seeping into the room and when I called the front desk (when the room phone didn't work) using my cell, the desk clerk told me it wasn't smoke it was just a spray they spray. A spray that smells like cigarette smoke? I don't know who would even make a spray that smells like cigarette smoke.

Super disappointing. We had switched over to Choice from Hampton but I don't know after this. I also, due to the poor cleaning, hope that we don't get the Coronavirus from staying here. We provided our feedback within the hotel. The same unfriendly person was who we spoke with Saturday evening. The floors were cleaned better Saturday. The rest was still dirty. We have no plans to stay there again. The employee who was working there Friday and Saturday night (vmehta, according to our receipt) does not belong in a customer service role, in my position. This was an awful experience and I'll be sure to go to a different hotel the next time. I have also emailed the manager but there were no changes aside from the floor being cleaned. Thank you. I spoke with my husband and we will accept this-disappointing not to receive any sort of apology from management, though. Dan Tulloh,  -207-5231,  Red Field St, Cary, NC, , # (from our receipt, so I hope this is what you need) . Thank you. When should I log in to see the points? Thanks!

I had multiple bites on both legs.   I went to front desk crying.  I also captured sereral of them & showed them to desk manager.    He was very apologetic but he said unfortunately we booked through a secondary site & he could not refund charge.   He offered us a different room - we declined & checked out.   I no longer have record of stay but our name Terry Jensen.   Lois Ave. Carroll, Iowa should be in your records.    They said they would put in notes.   Manager did call the next day but no resolution.   I never posted a negative comment on web as i realize it can happen.   Manager assured us room would be closed for  days & cleaned.

Confirmation number       You have picture of the rooms on your site when I booked,    WELL  my room looked NOTHING like the picture.   This hotel is very old.  there wasn't a desk in there and a very tiny bathroom.   Plus it was close to a very busy highway and you could hear traffic racing all night. I feel its false advertising when you show a picture of what your room will look like and then stay in a room that's old ,  towels were inconsistent  AND the towels I put outside the room to be replaced were not enough, I would put  outside and would get  in return.   Every time I asked the clerk to have them give us more towels , it never happened,  I would have to go dowstairs to get more.   this is NOT good customer service,  The clerks were very nice , but for some reason things did not get done.

Jonas Johansen. Hotel is comfort inn & suites Ashland Oregon. I did speak to the nightclerk about it it was after midnight. and I understand this point of view you're not going to go around start knocking on people's doors after midnight to find out who smoking pot in your hotel. My only hope is that these people are penalized and charged accordingly so that in the future they might reconsider their actions. Although you and I both know that's not going to happen. I guess unfortunately because of my allergy to marijuana I may just have consider staying in my truck more than your facilities. And it's not just yours I mean it's any hotel that has this problem. You guys should investigate in smoke detectors that will detect it and go off at least that way you can pinpoint the perpetrators easier   Oh I'm agreeing that I for the most part don't want anybody to have to deal with my second hand smoke I do my best to be courteous about it. There are people that have allergies. I have allergies to marijuana and it's family so mint etc. Just wish others were as considerate   Good luck to her and I hope the procedure goes well Thank you Liz I appreciate that.

"Hi weve been staying at one of your hotels for about  weeks now and not once have they done housekeeping in our room. I have mentioned this to several receptionists at the front desk but nothing has been done about it. Unfortunately I feel like I have to resort to this and hope that the issue will be resolved. Confirmation #79509143, #80215437, and #80693563 Aaron Velez Quality Inn & Suites  Market St, Reno, NV  Arrival date December , . Weve been staying in the same room up until now I also had a package that was delivered by UPS at the front desk at :10am on /22/2020 signed by RB go missing. Or according to the several receptionists that Ive talked to everyday that it never arrived. Not accusing the staff of stealing packages but just another thing that happened You see theres never a manager on site. Earlier today I asked for management and was told that there wasnt one and wouldnt be one until Monday. How is that so? Isnt there supposed to be a manager on shift all the time?? Forget the housekeeping issue, I dont think my missing package is getting the effort needed to be found from staff. It was a $325 value package. A friend whos also staying in this hotel had a package missing and as soon as he threaten to talk with someone with corporate his package was suddenly found  days later. Management said to check at La Quinta Inn & Suites in  Market St, Reno, NV  for package because they get packages mixed up all the time. Which in my opinion is total bs, excuse my language, because La Quinta is about a mile down the road with a totally different address. I am getting very frustrated about this all. Some receptionists seem to want to help with the problems Im having with this particular hotel, management on the other hand not so much.","Aaron Velez has been staying at La Quinta Inn & Suites Market St, Reno, NV for about weeks.

They left yesterday after your manager pounded on their door waking them up along with their dogs and the barking dog across the hall from them.   The address is  north Wilson road Columbus Ohio.    Its actually in a subdivision called Hilliard.    I expect that the debit cards be refunded immediately the amount paid for their stay from yesterday (January ,  - January , ) which was their expected check out date.   Instead of being able to enjoy time with his family while here before leaving for deployment for a year he had to spend yesterday getting set up to basically camp out - in  degree weather.   I am livid that he has had to deal with this.     Ya know it would have been different if A) they had been told when they checked in that couldnt have the dogs or B) your hotels sticker announcing how pet friendly the establishment is didnt boast the exact dog they have only a different color.     Thank you Im advance for taking care of refunding their money paid in advance. Please note Im fine with him contacting you but I am making sure that you know the way to avoid a lawsuit is to make sure their money is refunded.  They are not asking for a handout.

"I need to let your company know I believe there is a problem at one of your hotels. Ive stayed in many different hotels under you guys from Comfort Inn to Clarion and probably most under you guys. However, none have been so rude and unhelpful as the Comfort Inn in Redding ca. I simply want my deposit back and it has become an act of congress to even get the manager to come to the phone. After almost  weeks since our stay, I am getting very upset with what seems to be a big run around. Can you help? No, its not been resolved. My name is Jennifer Cole. My family and I stayed at the Comfort Inn off Mistletoe in Redding, ca on Dec th . We stayed one night, we were put in room . I used the Hotels.com app to secure the room. I also did not use the same card at check in as I did when I made the reservation. I chose to instead use my American Express Debit card ending in . 
 I didn't put enough cash on the card to cover both the room and deposit. However, when I originally went to check in, the lady checking me in, erroneously told me the charge wouldn't go through at the time, I agreed to go add more funds, and I did. 
 When I came back to the hotel after adding funds, there was a different lady at reception, and she didn't quite understand why I was leaving more money, as the card HAD in fact been charged $98.76 i believe. She then charged me another $57.50 for the deposit. 
 It has been nearly a month since we left the hotel. I would say since we checked out, however, after standing at reception to check out for several minutes and noone to be found anywhere, we walked out and left. We never got a receipt for the original $98. Nor the $57.50 until a week or so ago when I started asking where is  i did get a case number and the receipt from when we first tried checking in.
 The case #10105143 that was given to me by the  #.
 After calling the hotel itself and asking for a manager, I was told for over a week that I *just missed him* I finally got to speak to him late last week. He was extremely rude and very condescending with me and claimed his name is *Dan*. He also claims I never paid the $57.50 and had i, then I need to take it up with my bank. Ive called my bank multiple times, however, because the charge has never been cleared by the hotel, there is nothing the bank can do. I need the hotel to refund it back as we've done zero damage to the room we stayed in. Dan says there's no record of this charge. 
 The  # (800-300-8800) they also have called the hotel and came bk to me saying there is nothing they can do either. They did send me a copy of the original receipt, not the second one for the amount I am still out, $57.50. Monday, the th, will mark  month of dealing with this. I am very upset. I will NEVER stay in that hotel again. I really hope someone does some internal investigating on this particular hotel. I have never been treated so rudely while at a hotel nor after a stay. It is pretty sad when half the reviews mimic exactly what I am saying here. This needs to be fixed asap, please! No, this is definitely YOUR hotel, not my bank. Also, the th thru the th is more than  days. And yes, your hotel did release my funds from the ORIGINAL transaction. They don't recognize the second transaction. Ive had my bank many years, and their hands are always tied until the business releases the funds. Now I see your entire chain of hotels is a joke, there is zero care to your customers and I will never stay in another one of any of your Choice Hotels. How does one go about contacting someone above manager Dan at that particular hotel? They are rude and uncooperative. They will not work with me and have been very accusatory towards me. This is why I now have my own attitude. I do apologize. However, the lack of willingness to help me resolve this issue is astounding by this hotel's management. I tried to do the right thing and made  payments to that hotel. 
 I would love to communicate with someone at the corporate level. This is terrible business on that hotel's part. 
 Thank you anyway for at least trying to help me. I understand it is out of your control. 
 I do want to leave a positive comment about the Comfort Inn in Shasta Lake, ca . Just up the road from the above problem one. They have had us a few times as patrons. They have always been very pleasant and easy to work with.  The hotel itself is pretty nice and the beds and amenities have always been perfect for my family and myself.

to me

Hello Jennifer,
 
First, I hope you're having a safe and wonderful day and may this email finds you well. 
 
Our commitment and top priority is our guests health and safety during this time of pandemic. I apologize that you had to deal with all this issues during your stay.
 
It is disappointing that you are unable to enjoy your stay because of the condition of the room. Rest assured, your comments have been duly noted under the case number .
 
I would love to have another opportunity to show you how great it can be to stay with Choice Hotels. I am not able to process a refund directly to your credit card as each of our hotels maintains their billing transactions independently of Choice Hotels. We usually offer refunds thru check, however our staffing has been affected by the COVID crisis which means theres no one to process it at the moment.
 
As an alternative, I would like to offer you ,000 points instead. This is the fastest method as you will receive them within  hours and are redeemable immediately after they've been accepted. These points can be used towards free nights, gift cards and more. To help us finalize the process, please respond to this email with your acceptance.
 
and include the following information.
 
- Full Name
- Home address
- Phone number
- Birthdate (mm/dd)
 
I appreciate your understanding on this matter. I am looking forward to your response.
 
Again, I am truly sorry you had a frustrating experience with a Choice branded property, but I hope you will give us another chance next time you are in need of a place to stay. Thank you for your continued patronage with Choice Hotels. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Charisse

Dubose guest John & Jennifer Waugh The hotel directly told us that we must have brought the bugs So you should see and understand how I am requesting directly from your corporate services as they are not willing to work with me. How about this since the room was booked for two nights-you send two nights worth of stay? at any hotel Or make it three for the troubles!!!! The laundry mats washing, the anxiety of the bugs coming home, the throwing away a very sentimental suitcase that my grandmother bought for me for my college graduation (who is now deceased). The bombing spray that we had to purchase to spray our our vehicle, the continuous vacuuming of the vehicle-I could go on.

"What's up with the discrepancy between points and $ rates? I rarely use points anymore because the AAA rate is so low. I'm not gonna use -14,000 points when I can pay $53.

"Staying at the Quality Inn on St. Elmo in Austin, TX.  Power has been out since approx.  am.  The hotel manager refuses to come up with more blankets.  There are empty rooms in the hotel.  This is poor treatment of your guests of not neglience. Jeff Clark

Jeff Clark -214-4226 There are small children in this hotel and temps are reaching a dangerous situation. I just requested towels to use as blankets from the manager and was refused them.  When I asked for his name he told me he was nameless and he told me that he was going to call  to have me removed from the property. Please let me know that someone has actually seen this. The manager has now called the police to have us removed from the property.  The police told us we could not be forced to leave since we have paid for the night. We have left the property.  The owner call the police last night to evict us and stopped by our room this morning to remind us checkout was at . The only staff at the hotel since we checked in Friday morning was the manager.  As I've said said he was not willing to provide anything to make my stay safe or pleasant.  He also would not provide his name,, saying he had no name.  There was no housekeeping at all during our stay.  Just in case, I have photos of the state we left the room in. 

We have made an online reservation at a Comfort Suite in Buda, TX. It should be at least double that since we had  nights with no heat.  

Also, safety standards were not met.  Emergency lighting in the hallways and stairwells failed so stairwells were pitch dark.  We bring flashlights when we travel but other guests did not have them.  The manager's solution was open firedoors. The member number is JXC13960

Email:  
Address:   Queens Way N, Stillwater, MN  I do want to know that you will follow up with the manager of that property.  Calling the police to evict a customer who did nothing illegal is beyond the pale.  He needs to know that corporate is aware and there need to be consequences.  

There also needs to be corrective and preventive actions taken on the safety issues.  At one point he said to me that the generator would not start.  Later he said that there was no generator and had not said that.  It would seem that a generator to keep emergency lighting working is appropriate.

In a conversation before the power went out he told me that he had been asked by the city to house some homeless people during cold snap but had refused stating, ""I don't want those people in here.""  Since keeping paying customers safe was not a priority, that is not a surprising response but a disappointing one.  People in Texas are suffering with the cold weather.  When one has the resources to help they should. Thank you.  We are currently at another Choice Hotel in Buda, TX, and I have nothing but good things to say about this stay.  There is staff on site who are working hard to make the best of a bad situation.  There was a problem with the heater in our room.  Maintenance diagnosed the problem quickly,  replaced the faulty part and made certain it was working properly before leaving our room.  This property gets an excellent rating in my book.","Jeff Clark stayed at the Quality Inn on St. Elmo in Austin, TX.

"I recently stayed at the Sleep Inn in Danville, VA /18/21-2/20/21 and I was sent a survey via email to complete on my recent stay. I answered the survey honestly and I felt as if customer service was non existent and front desk staff were not welcoming at all. I thought the rooms were clean and comfortable. I included all this on my survey. Today I received this response from the General manager and I dont know about you but this is the furthest from customer service. This is the most passive aggressive, condescending email. If sleep inn didnt want my honest review, only to receive a nasty email like this then why send me a survey?  Based on this, I dont plan on ever staying at another choice hotel again if this is the type of disrespect shown to paying customers and the type of customer service environment that choice hotels fosters.

"Be careful when booking with Woodspring. I recently traveled to Beaumont, TX for work. Booked three days and paid daily, then extended a week. After  days in my week I got a call from work requesting that I switch cities. I assumed there would be a charge to switch my reservation to the nearest woodspring suites but was advised thats not possible. All in all i ended up paying  for exactly  week at the most mediocre place ive ever stayed. The staff has absolutely no compassion or could care less that I am in their town to help their people. Meanwhile I feel like i got robbed. Never. Again. Be. Careful.  Thank you for getting back to me regarding my comment. I arrived at Woodspring, Beaumont tx on /20 and originally booked until /23 on a daily rate which came out to .76. My company acorn claim service advised I would be in town for a week due to the freeze so I booked at the weekly rate on /24 for .45. I then got a call stating they needed to relocate me to Galveston, tx and I would need to check out /29. I went to the front desk to see if we could work anything out (ie charge me  days at daily rate. Or  days at the day rate on my new reservation and refund the difference. Im aware I signed a non-refund policy so Im probably out of luck but I truely feel like there should be some consideration in certain scenarios. I paid  for an  day stay. If you would like to discuss my phone number is . Thank you for listening. WoodSpring Suites I appreciate you taking the time to respond. I have sent my booking details in a private message for review. Best regards.  WoodSpring Suites Thank you!! After receiving your response I know I will definitely not stay here again. I am sick to my stomach.    Ok. I was really hoping something could be done. Obviously Im

Confirmation Number:  I wasn't expecting the charge to still hit my account a day later. I am now overdrawn on my bank account over a room charge I thought was adjusted days ago. So basically I will still be paying for this room in overdraft charges. Okay thanks. Good thing I have a video of the coackroaches and a picture of the roach right next to my bill. I guess I'll be working on writing my review now. I should have never been charged for the cockroach infested room to begin with! Their would have never been overdraft charges. No one even told me I would still be charged for the room for the next -10 days! Had I been made aware of that I could have avoided the bank charges.","Amanda Stevens stayed in one of your hotels in Ogden, Utah over the weekend.

"Always used Priceline before joining choice hotels. I love using choice hotels   But dont understand how Priceline is cheaper even after adding their fees! well my last seven nights I booked thru choice even though it was higer because I like dealing with choice and getting the rewards, and feel that If I have a problem they would be very helpful, just wish they could have closer rates to places like priceline, also tried to book this morning for our stay tonight and it keeps telling me there is no hotels availablerewards rewards should not have been at the end no just for tonight OK thanks my sister has already booked one for tonight maybe it will work next time",Priceline is cheaper even after adding their fees!

"Man, whos in charge of these places? Spoke to a manager to try and work something out at the Sleep inn in Lubbock Texas and their customer service is less than one star to keep in cordial. I believe this is all the information you requested. Choice Hotels just did  So you asked me to message private just to keep people in the dark then didn't even respond?  That's shady. I'll make sure to let everyone know how my service with not only myself, but the  other families I convinced to take refuge in your hotel  had.... mind you we all had the same service! Choice Hotels your website states some sites may not have certain amenities... if there are not available why not take them off so that theres no miscommunication? I convinced  other families...  with my own to stay at your hotel and once I got there found out you had no pool cause of covid. Ok... I can give that a break but then found out from another guest that you guys didn't have breakfast either. Wasnt  even told about this when I check in either!  Then when I brought my concern up to your desk agent I was basically told it's my fault for not asking!  This seriously  was disturbing as your site doesn't exactly say what hotels have what. Then I asked what they could do to resolve these issues and was told those amenities were free so no discount could be made for anyone. Not to mention one of my family's had their rook flooded and was moved from a  queen bed room to a  queen with a pull out couch. I was called by the manager from your branch to be told again that was not their fault and nothing could be done. I seriously disagree with that and hoped this could be resolved in a more cordial manner. Unfortunately... here we are.  Guys look for my previous post before checkin in to these places Jessica Williamson beware... look for my previous post What is ,000 points?? This was our first time staying somewhere other than a Holiday inn for their outstanding service. Sorry you think this was just about me but as I mentioned, I'm the secretary/travel coordinator for the #SAOUTLAWSBASKETBALL team and I was the one who made sure myself along with  other families booked here instead of Holiday Inn for once in our travels.  I would hope I wasn't the only one being compensated. Let me get with them tonight and I'll get back to you with their information as well. Where do the points get deposited?? Ok and what information do you need from the other families?  I'm not sure because I didn't send it all to you individually.  I just sent you my whole itinerary. And where do we go to find out how to redeem our points I would like info on places to stay in Corpus Christi, texas please and how to use points there? The link I only saw stores Then why not issue all the constituents at least  for the amount we at least spent on the whole family for the  nights  mornings there. I'm sure we would all be willing to look past this incident and continue forward with new stays with yall as the new hotel of choice in the future instead of Holiday Inn? How much money is  points for a night? Because I'm sure we will still have to pay out of pocket so I know? If you issue  amd the room cost ... how much will I need to pay out of pocket is what I was asking? Goodafternoon.  The other person's information is here. Choice Hotels Res Conf#  for /12/21  PM at Sleep Inn & Suites, Lubbock, TX. The other  already got in contact with corporate with their issues as well. It would be a lot better if we could at least be issues  credits each so we don't come out of our pockets on out next  or  night says. Just depends on what tournament or what city we end up going to next. Goodafternoon. Did mine get applied already? I have forward the information to the proper people. I do understand your point of view about this situation, Frantino. Keep in mind that due to the ongoing Pandemic some of the hotels' amenities were suspended. For example, on the website, you could find under the hotel's alerts that ""Some hotel features, including fitness centers, pools, food and beverage, and other amenities may not be available at this time due to COVID-19"" Nevertheless, your feedback is valuable to us; for that reason, we would like to increase our offer to ,000 points as a final offer for the issues faced. Should you find this offer, acceptable, please reply with your information so that we can deposit the points. -Numas And this was my information... what is it exactly that you're missing now?

"Choice Hotels bologna! We had a problem with a Rodeway Inn. Called customer care twice. They did nothing!!! Told us to work it out with the hotel. What a joke. Weve been choice members for over  years. Wont stay at another choice hotel. Trusted hotels my butt!!! Will NEVER stay at another choice hotel again. Been members for over  years. We normally stay at comfort suites, but it was booked. We made reservations at a Rodeway inn because Phoenix was busy and that's all we could find. We got there at about  pm
 Stood outside in  degree weather for over an hour. My husband is  with a bad back and knees. I am .  The lobby was being used for storage. They had a window for check ins. The clerk was rude. She was the only one there on a  hour shift. She bad mouthed the owners and the hotel. Prostitutes and homeless were walking around the parking lot.  The hotel looked run down. A truck driver that stays there regularly said if anything is wrong with the room let the clerk know immediately or you wont get your deposit back. We finally got to the window to be told our room wasn't ready. Come back in an hour. We went to Walmart to buy disinfectant to clean the room. We returned to a long line. We called customer care to cancel our reservation. They tried to call the hotel. What a joke. We told them she was busy. She didnt answer. We left and were charged for the room. We have called customer care twice. They told us to work it out with the hotel. Trusted hotel my butt. You put your Choice Hitel name on a run down crappy hotel and dont stand behind it. Shame on you Choice hotels. You wont be my next Choice.

Choice Hotels Gretel we have done this twice already. Customer care did nothing to help us. They called the hotel the first time and got no answer. The second time we called you the desk clerk answered and told you guys the manager was not available. Customer care told us to work it out with the hotel.  It has not been resolved.

Honestly if we paid for the points I dont see why we have to occupy the room to get them. We showed up twice to check in. The first time our room wasn't ready. The second time there was still a line to check in. It was for his birthday,  we planned dinner out, not the evening standing in line, at a flee bag overpriced  hotel. And my husband wanted you to know he called you guys  times today. Agent #1 called the hotel, after  minutes on hold he was hung up on. Agent #2 disconnected him after she started reading the notes on the account, #3 tried to help him but he couldnt get the hotel to answer after  minutes. This isn't the first time we had problems. I paid for a room in Mississippi and near the Grand Canyon in AZ. we were denied our points because I paid with my credit card and the choice privileges is my husband's name. Have a great day.

"Sounds good until you leave something behind and the manager, who was COMPLETELY not helpful tells you your wrong (even though they show at his hotel). I asked for camera footage, denied. And I asked for his bosses number and he refused. So if you stay in these hotels, dont leave ANYTHING behind. Theyll keep it.   Hello. Below youll find a copy of my information. Heres what happened. Sunday morning I used my Apple airpods. When I got done I put them under a pillow. Well when we checked out I forgot them and did not notice until Tuesday I was missing them. I pulled up their location and it showed that hotel in Arkansas. I immediately called and the gentleman said hed get with the manager and give me a call Wednesday. Well Wednesday about noon I never heard from anyone so I called In. The manager asked me to call back at . So I did. He said he only has  housekeeper and his housekeeper never turned in anything. I told him I KNOW my airpods were left there. I know that for a % fact! And he said well let me ask my house keeper. So he did. I guess she said she never found anything (it was in a different language so I cant verify that) he then said hed go up to the room to verify but that room had been cleaned. I asked if he could pull cameras. He said no. I asked him if I could get his bosses number because my AirPods were left on the bed under the pillow. So not finding them wasnt acceptable. He said he was the only boss. I said youre the owner? He said no and refused to give me any more information. Eventually he started yelling and wouldnt let me talk. Im appalled by this service. My apple airpods by the way, have my name engraved on them. So the housekeeper or manager who took them from that room have my airpods with Chelsey Apple on them  Choice Hotels just messaged you!  Yes and they are lying to you. But thats okay. Well never be staying with you guys again, nor our baseball team. Disappointed is an understatement but hopefully the house keeper or the manager enjoys the airpods. Might wanna clean up your Facebook too  You calling did nothing but waste my time.

JXW132925 Personally I dont think  points touches the headache it has been. I have been charged twice one of which is still pending for  on my credit card. When I book a hotel I expect it to be booked In Purchased these points and I feel like its false advertising that youre offering this % off spring deal and every time I purchase it you wait a few days to send me an email and tell me its canceled.  My trip is just under two weeks away my flight has been booked for weeks and now Ive had to scramble and pay double the price because all the hotels have went up in that area due to spring break almost $2000 for a property That was only $650 March  when we were shopping around for hotels. We pick the Cambria because its a like new hotel. I am a news reporter. Im calling corporate about this. Ive spoke to at least eight of your reps no one will send me to the US call center or put me on the phone with a manager. I gave up three hours of my workday on Monday and spoke to five people alone. One more at  oclock this morning and nobody seems to care about your poor customer service and the fact that my trip has been almost ruined because of your lack of support and false advertising I freelance for a large national travel magazine and you need to let your media relations department know about the difficulties I have half a mind to be calling them. This is major false advertising advertising these points and not applying them and ruining peoples trips. The fact that none of your customer service reps have cared enough to fix this problem for me approximately eight of them now and have disregarded my issues is apalling. I think your brandingmarketing team and especially your media relations team would be mortified that this is a service to give your customers by outsourcing your customer relations to international outbound call centers. You have not upheld your points deals youre advertising. Most organizations give me free things to test out and write about and pitch things to me hoping Ill give a good review. I chose your hotel on my own merit and the review Im going to give if somebody does not make this right is going to be very very bad - as its been a horrible experience. I would like a phone call back not an email not a Facebook message this evening thank you very much. My number is listed in the message above. Also, I want the $585 pending charge on my credit card removed. Youve tried to charge me twice and my friend  times. As I stated, I would like a return call. And we each need to be reimbursed for your false advertising. Ive sent my phone number above and asked for a phone call twice. But for your convenience to clearly not read my customer complaint and request, have a manager contact me at -575-1329. My issue and Lindsays are different. We both had issues with cards being charged; points being cancelled. You can address her issue with her and mine with me - on my end I want to know why youre advertising these points and conducting false advertising. I would like a phone call as stated above. You tried to call me at almost pm EST. Unacceptable. Have someone in the US corporate office call me today before am EST or after pm EST.

"We had the worst experience ever when we booked a stay at the Altamonte Springs Mainstay in Florida. The ladies at the front desk were very nice and kept apologizing, but I do not understand how this hotel is operating like this and allowing people to sleep in these deplorable conditions. There was a butter knife stuck in the top of the door, the bedding looked like bedbug droppings were left in it, the bed skirt had nasty residue on it, the door had red and black stuff on it, and the floors were sticky.

" I have many issues with a room at the Quality Inn in Columbia, TN. The entire staff was rude and did not let me or my SO address concerns with management (thank you Tim) so here I am. Can we discuss in DM? Thank you. Some pics included from my room  Thank you for the reply! I just got off work but me and my partner are getting everything together now and will have everything sent in the morning. Hello! Thank you for the response. Since my partner is the one who booked and paid for the room, I let him write a summary of our experiences. As he does not have a Twitter, any further communication should be directed to him as the room was booked under his name, Derrick Johnson. His number is (269)447-3198. I am still happy to assist in any way I can via DMs since I was also in this room. I am not sure where the confirmation number is on our receipt, so Ive included a photo of our receipt with all requested information. 

I booked a room at this establishment and planned to stay for  days. When I arrived with my fiance, we were overjoyed since we have been looking forward to this trip. Once we arrived, everything looked fine. At least for the first hour. The longer we stayed in the room, the more we started to notice that wasnt right. 

On the first day, we saw what appeared to be blood stains on the carpet and on the ceiling. There were red stains on the carpets and yellow stains on the shower curtain. There were stains in the actual tub and stains in and on the walls around the hot tub, which we paid extra for. I talked to somebody at the front desk and they said that they had no other rooms with the hot tub. Since I paid extra for the hot tub, I wasn't going to take another room and not get reimbursed the extra charge for the hot tub. So we had to make do. My fianc actually took some of the provided towels and cleaned our hot tub herself since we couldnt be sure it was even clean.

The next day I got a hold of housekeeping and requested extra towels, new sheets and maybe a new comforter. I was told that out of the entire hotel, there was only one comforter for the king size bed that we had. And it was already on our bed with weird, brown stains. We did get additional towels and bed sheets at least. The housekeeper was kind, at least. 

As the days went on, more and more stains just started to appear. On the curtains, on top of the heater, and everywhere else that you could possibly imagine. There even seemed to be some black mold in the bathroom around the bathtub.

It pretty much got to the point where me and my fiance didn't want to be in the room unless we had to sleep. We didn't want the hot tub to go to waste, though. The fittings on the hot tub were really loose, coming off with the slightest touch. We made sure to clean it ourselves after every use after our first night. 

Half of the outlets in the room didn't even work, and one of them was even installed upside down. The ironing board had some stain or burn on it but that wasnt a big deal to us since we didnt need it, but it definitely didnt look fit to use. Our experience overall was just horrible. 

Upon checkout I simply wished to speak to somebody about the condition of the room. I didn't want to complain and I wasn't looking for a handout or full reimbursement. I simply just wanted to bring these issues up with the person responsible so they could be fixed. However, the person that I talked to at the counter, Tim, was very rude to me. When I asked to speak to somebody about the condition of the room, he immediately assumed I was looking for a handout since he said ""you were in there five days and youre now just saying something.

The truth is, I said something on day one but was told that I couldn't be helped. So I had no other choice. I had already paid almost $500 for this room. I at first only wanted to address the issues with our room with management so they could get the proper cleaning and maintenance done for the next guest who books the hot tub suite. The staff was no help so I took to posting a review on the official website for the hotel, which theyve since deleted. That was the reason for reaching out to your company via Twitter. We have no issue removing the tweet at your request so long as some action is taken. 

We have a collection of  photos of just our room conditions, which can be sent via Twitter DMs or can be emailed.  Thank you again for the response. My fianc and I are going to decline the ,000 points. We still are not looking for a handout, a refund, points, or anything of that nature. We just want the hotel in question to look into the room we were staying in. No guest should have to question if the red stains on the ceiling, carpets, heating unit, and curtains are blood stains, especially in the middle of a pandemic. While the points are nice, it still wouldnt make up for how disgusting our room was, how rude the staff was once we had a complaint, or the fact I had to clean the room myself because of how unsure we were if its cleanliness. I understand housekeeping isnt perfect, things will be missed. But this was just unacceptable. My fianc feels a bit insulted that it seems you havent read the full last message I sent with the full details of how awful our stay was and just how rude your staff at this property is. We just want you to address this issue with your staff so this room is not in such horrendous conditions for the next guest who has to book a room there. At this point, we still would not like any form of points compensation because we will no longer be staying at Choice Hotels properties.","The Quality Inn in Columbia, TN was booked under Derrick Johnson's name.

"The hotel staff is nice and the hotel is clean. The management is very good!! They stick to there policies and they will let nothing trough. I am out  dollars and hopefully this review will deter someone from making my mistake. 
So my mistake.  After a long drive I finally get to the hotel.  I went to hotels.com and accidentally booked a room a day in advance. I immediately call the hotel.com and after telling them about my simple error. Hotels.com called the hotel and the Comfort Inn stood by the policy. The policy is that I could not get a refund or change the date on the reservation to a future date. 
If I wasnt a good guy, I would invest heavily in Comfort Inn because in my opinion they take advantage of their customers when they make mistakes.  Theyre a big chain and instead of showing some discretion they have that power!! 
I am a good guy.  I am a human and make mistakes. I learned my lesson therefore I will stay away from all Comfort Inns and all there sister chains. I will tell my story. I made the mistake, and I want to make sure no one else falls into this trap. I am going to tell people to be careful when you walk into Comfort Inn. Be careful when you give them your credit card. Management doesnt care if you make a mistake. They are a big business and they need to protect that policy!! Now, in a few months. I am going to be speaking in front of thousands and thousands of people. I will tell my story and hopefully this message gets across. Stay away from Comfort Inn.
The staff was excellent super helpful, management is strict, and just be careful at the Comfort Inn on I40 Exit  in Gallup.  I stayed at the Comfort Inn at I-40 Gallup, New Mexico.The hotel staff was nice and the hotel was clean. The management is very good!! They stick to there policies and they will let nothing through.  
It was a long trip. I was exhausted. I stopped at Comfort Inn. I miss read the dates. The moment I realized it. It was to late. I hit submit and immediately regretted it. I called hotels.com for a refund or at least change the date. Hotels.com made me wait. 
Hotels.com told me that Comfort Inn will stick to there policy. I think someone needs to reconsider there judgment.  I think what Comfort Inn is doing is wrong. Comfort Inn will not give it back. Please give me my money back!  Save yourself some money and headaches.  dollars is not worth it. They make rules to take advantage of their customers. 
My advice stay away from Comfort Inn or any hotels on the Choice Hotels list.  What are you talking about? I did reply. 
No one responded back to me! Figures... a bot is answering these posts and direct messages. Check in date was Mon, March  thru March  :00pm check in time  night stay

"Welp. After being promised compensation weve gotten nothing. Not even an attempt to contact. So here we go. 

We arrived at the Quality Inn Kenly at about am this past Saturday morning. I had booked a drive up room because we had the baby and so many things to carry. 

I go into reception and the receptionist isnt wearing a mask. She checks me in and tells me were on the second floor. I show her my reservation she tells me she cant do anything and theyre booked oops oh well too bad. She also gave me another dirty pen after me telling her that the pen I had access to was in the dirty cup. After driving  and a half hours this was a bad start but whatever. 

We get up to the room and the entire thing REEKS of weed and cigarettes. We booked a non smoking room. 

On every surface is that lovely sticky stuff shown below. In every corner there are crumbs. Clearly the room wasnt cleaned. The pillows which I didnt get a photo of were STAINED  The floor (carpet) was STICKY 

I literally used my own blanket I was so disgusted. I felt like a bad mother letting my child stay in that room. But we didnt have a choice at that point. 

We make it through the night and I go to check out and... nobody is there. Says be back in . Im frustrated but theres a phone and it says to call if you need to so I did. 

I say I need to check out and she asks if I need a receipt leaving me to believe that had I not wanted one or had to talk to someone she would have just let us leave without checking out leaving us liable for anything. Big yikes. 

I tell her I dont need a receipt but I need to speak to someone and she said shed be there in a few minutes. She arrives and you guessed it NO MASK!! Mind you were in a state where its a law. This woman is sweating and breathing heavily in my face without a mask. I was holding my breath. 

So I go on to tell her about the experience. She lets me know the woman from the night before lied about giving us $25 compensation. Uhm? Anyway she seems genuinely sorry and disgusted. She starts crying and getting emotional. And Im like okay.... and she lets me know her mother passed away from covid. All while crying and leaking fluids from her face  feet from me WITHOUT A MASK!!!!!!!! At this point I just want my money back or something to be done. 

She tells me shes giving me her personal phone number and that she will be contacting people personally for me to get us a free room at any choice hotel on our way back because shes so sorry and this was so unacceptable. This is the assistant property manager btw. She takes my phone number and email and promises me up and down shell contact me both ways by Sunday night at the latest when it got less busy. 

Well. Its Thursday. No contact. No compensation. Im absolutely livid. Chelsea Crocetti.

"We are having a horrible experience with Choice Hotels.  My daughter has Covid and is in quarantine.  We are attempting to cancel her reservation.  We are being told no because it was pre-paid.  I will be writing to the State to let them know that Choice Hotels is not working with people who have Covid and we will NEVER pre-pay or use Choice Hotels again.    I've been on hold for at least  hours.  Started with the hotel and was told they could not refund since they couldn't even see the credit card info.  They said to contact Choice Hotels Corporate.  Corporate (after a lengthy hold) transferred me to customer Relations.  Customer Relations spoke to the hotel and they said I would need to call back to speak with the General Manager.  So I am back to where I started.  Horrible service and I will let everyone know that they should reconsider a stay with Choice Hotels! I understand that there are certainly restrictions on advanced purchases. But Covid has changed our world and companies have had to adapt to Accommodate things that are Beyond our control. She is in Quarantine and cannot travel. I would hope that Choice  Hotels would be more concerned about a customers health than making a profit on a room that wont be used.  No one has inquired about how she is at all.  I have spent two days on this now, trying to help her since she cant wait on hold for hours at a time due to how shes feeling.  Her reservation wasnt even for another nine days when I first called. Plenty of time to re-rent the room without any negative effect on anyone.  I will be waiting to see how this is handled.

I did contact them- he stated that this non refund policy was set up by the owner to deal with multiple cancellations that were said to be Covid.  Bottom line is that we are being Penalized by the hotels desire to recoup lost dollars due to the Pandemic which is illegal.  I hope they do refund because my next step is to contact the State authorities",My daughter has Covid and is in quarantine. We are attempting to cancel her reservation.

"How would I go about getting a refund for a REALLY BAD hotel stay? The customer service email doesn't seem to work. Thank you for responding to me.
The date was Saturday, April rd in North Charleston, SC. I'm not sure where the receipt is. My son may still have it since he paid for the room. His name is Leo Vatter.
It was just such a horrible night. There were cars revving in the parking lot with loud music thumping, people arguing/fighting outside. And inside-my god. It was downright gross. The floors, the tub, even the ceiling was a mess. Gross bedspreads and a broken toilet seat. We both slept on top of the bedspread with our clothes on. We didn't dare get under the sheets. 
It was truly a disgusting experience and I'd really like to see my son get his money back. That wasn't a hotel, it was a hovel, and you should be embarrassed to have your name attached to it. Also, if you're interested in pictures, I'm happy to send them. Econo Lodge North  Northside Drive, North Charleston, SC 

I'll get ahold of my son and see if he still has the receipt so that I can get that info to you.

And a little info about the pictures - that's toilet paper being used as a door stop in the bathroom and also to fill a hole in the wall. And if I remember right, we were in room  or .

"I hope everybody on this feed read my post. I am a Diamond member who stayed frequently at their Choice Hotel in Henderson Nevada. A month ago I made reservations to stay  days in a row. I was told by an employee the manager made some negative comments bout me. During my stay my reservations were disrupted by the hotel meaning they canceled part of my reservation. That morning I got a Bill notified the front desk I had several days left to stay and they themselves canceled my reservations. After contacting the MGR they wanted to charge me about $30.00 more per night to rebook. I notified customer relations they contacted the hotel and resolve my stay. After a couple more days I left early and filled out a survey.

I received an email from the MGR asking me what was the problem. As a professional I stated kindly that an employee informed me negative things were said about me but I decided to just pray about it and told her if there is something I done wrong to please address me personally. I concluded with kind words and was willing to let it go.

Two weeks later I made reservations only to find out this young manager banned me. Now keep in mind I done nothing wrong but complained to customer relations and filled out a survey.

Choice executive contacted me  and finally got a response from the manager. The manager said I was banned because she has a video of one hour and a half of me mistreating her staff verbally and I was racist.

This is a Blatant lie and I ask that every member ask Choice Executive to get any video of me mistreating anybody. It a lie and a defamation of character. I replied I never had any altercation with anybody ever there. Second how in the hell am I racist? The staff is  percent Hispanic and the manager is a minority. I informed Choice that my family has various races of people and I am a minority! So Choice replied that it is true their staff of employees is what I stated and that I have a valid point.

I was banned because I contacted Customer Relations and completed a survey that was truthful but complimentary overall. So people i stayed over  plus nights throughout  in the Henderson Hotel Suite and the staff there like me very well. This young manager created a fabricated lie and now I am asking Choice Executives to review any video of my conduct. You know why Choice Executives have yet to receive the video? because there is not one of me of such nature. This is a lie and defamatory! I am a professional and a decent guy who treat people with respect. I want an apology and action against this hotel taken by Choice Executive! I am very offended! All because I filled out a survey and contacted Customer Relations to fix a problem they screwed up! Lj Smith read my post! I am staying with IHG as well! Choice Hotels I have I called your executive a few minutes ago! Just hurtful that a manager would defame my character and I have done nothing wrong but showed respect and kindness!  Choice Hotels I have privately sent your corporation emails. I do not wish to disclose the reference number publicly but please refer to Customer Relations Executives comments. Thank You! No its not resolved I will send you a response tomorrow. I already filed a complaint with Choice International Executives but if you cannot access that information I will send you my responses Arrival Date February ,  - March ,  but I was so unhappy I checked out on March , 

Hotel: Comfort Inn and Suites  Mark Street Henderson, Nevada

Name: TROY Collier

Confirmation Number: 

I was mistreated, defamed, and banned because I completed a Survey, I found out the manager made negative comments about me, and I contacted Customer Relations on March ,  because the Hotel cancelled my reservations. 

The hotel blatantly lied and defamed me by saying there is a video of me that last an hour and half or  minutes showing me verbally insulting their staff. The hotel called me a racist! These are defamatory hurtful comments that both Comfort Inn and  Monica Abrams are liable. 

You will not find a video of me insulting or arguing with anyone. 

Please review my comments and the Hotel owners should fire this manager immediately! Called me a racist and the hotel is  percent Hispanic workers,  percent Indian and Black, and  percent all others. My fianc is Hispanic. My family is a mixed race melting pot of different ethnicities. How dare she accuse me and used such defamatory comments about my character. I never argued with anybody and got along with the entire staff. I have been asked to both express my comments on both radio and social media. Confirmation Number 

The hotel cancelled this on March , 

Customer Relations rebooked me

" Just one of the many issues with your hotel Sleep Inn in Dania Beach, Florida. Kenneth Anderson /11/2021  We stayed there /11/2021-4/13/2021. The room was ok until we smelled something in the bed. I rolled back the sheets and saw this huge stain. We went and got cleaning products due to our flight being canceled due to weather. The bathroom didnt look like it was cleaned as the tube still had stains and the vent was broken off and very dirty. I am asking for a refund as this was unacceptable and very dangerous dealing with the pandemic. I was expecting it to be cleaned and it wasnt.     Also looks as if there was mold in the bathroom ceiling as well. Good morning. I checked out this morning and the attendant wasnt much help. He kind of was hiding in the back and when I had questions he did not answer. It got worst as we saw a roach this morning and had a small lizard in the room as well.

"Curtis Fry Are you sure about that? I booked a room at the Clarion in Orlando through choice hotels. No one was there to check us in. We waited  hours! Another couple was locked out of their room with all their luggage. They missed their flight because no one was there to let them in their room. Cops were called and they said there was nothing they could do. I had to have  kids sleep in a rental car! I called Choice Hotels many times asking them to please help us get another room. I never got my money back until I claimed a dispute with my credit card company. Guess what choice gave me for all that?!  points lol!! There is not even a econolodge under ,000. Choice Hotels How is that performance check working for the Clarion in Florida?? Tiffany Besse same. I will also make sure not only is family aware but all my socail media followers and friends. I cannot believe they are still in business  Rob Petrillo well at least you got to meet this elusive Nino! He never showed up to check us in to the clarion in orlando right in front of econolodge. He was gone! Phone went to voicemail. Went to the econolodge and it said if you need help go to the clarion! Cops were called and he was no where to be seen. Waiting  hours and finally had to sleep in a rental with  kids. And they never gave me my money back. Craziest s*&^ I have ever seen!  Rob Petrillo I will stay far away from anything with the choice name now. I stayed on hold with choice for  hours after being disconnected twice asking them to please help us get another place to stay and they never helped. Later I got  points . I felt even worse for another couple who had been sitting there for .5 hours when we got there. Their key wouldnt work to their room and all their luggage was locked in there. They missed their flight and the rental car return deadline! They called the cops and they cops said nothing they could do and  that it has been going very downhill for a long time.  They also charge you when no one is at the hotel to check you in! Even if you have to sleep in your car! But dont worry they will give you  points. Go look and see what that gives ya! Nothing. Curtis Fry are you fn kidding me I didnt get a refund. I had to have  kids sleep in a rental car of a town I didnt know. Why complain! They charged me for a room I never got. I had  kids sleep in a car on VACATION. Another couple missed their flight and rental car return because no one would let them in. If choice was so great they would have helped me find another place to stay. You cant even get a half of a night at ecololodge for  points.  Something wrong you bro And why the f would I have a plan B? I booked the room. Maybe you should try a real hotel if think you need a plan B after paying for a room.  Quit the crack dude Curtis Fry excellent room lmao. No I gave choice hotels the chance to refund me. I had to wait to dispute it with my bank because they kept giving me the run around. Not something someone wants to do on their vacation. And something that should have never ever happened and wouldnt have happened with a reputable company. And I am trying to warn others. Doesnt take a rocket scientist to look at reviews and see they're crap. You have your lil love affair with choice but I will continue to warn other people. There are plenty of places to stay that you dont need a plan B dumbest shit I've ever heard Curtis Fry  I guess my standards are just that high that I actually want to be checked into a room I paid for. I know I must be so entitled to expect to receive a room I paid for. No one takes you seriously dude. You're obviously a troll or you have some weird attachment to them. Curtis Fry ""excellent for those with a plan B""  so you're telling people if you book with them there  is a good chance you will need to book  rooms just in case  seriously something wrong with you. And yes I raised ill equipped children because I didnt want to sleep  in a rental car after I booked months in advance. Seriously you're a special kind of dumb. And my nd grader has better rational  Curtis Fry yup one that thinks they need a back up when booking with Choice Hotels . You're obviously infatuated and it's gotten a lil weird.

Hi, there! I know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so it's disappointing to hear it was not what you were expecting. To better assist you, can you plz send us a DM with your conf #, date of arrival, full name, & the hotel's address? Hope to hear from you! -LM I sent a tweet about the breakfast I got at your hotel, you sent this Here is the fare we were offered, a bag of apples and chewy bars My sister paid for the room thru priceline My name is Devin
Not sure we were supposed to be in that room where they used to have breakfast, stuff was all over and the ""food"" just thrown about.
I learned later that they put brown lunch bags on a table near the front desk for guests with an apple a nd a granola bar in it I got a good price so not complaining, but it was a shock after seeing what other hotels had
Like juice boxes, cereal boxes, milk cartons, individual pastries, etc. I have no quarrel with saving money, but advertising breakfast and then its an apple and a chewy bar was kinda deceptive
Plus I was on rd floor and elevator didn't work after st day
I am older, so stairs is a big problem, and my teeth are not great so no way could eat the ""breakfast"" lol
But again I got a good price, so I'll take the lack of amenities
I won't stay there again, staff doesn't care and everything is run shoddily, plus no upfront about breakfast
Just prefer a friendly place where I get what is advertised FYI, staff did help when asked, but basically they just could care less and it was evident
I get that it's mostly contractors and stuff that stay there, so maybe they don't need to be so friendly, but still stuff like clock didn't work, phone cord would not go in phone, making it useless, took  days to get toilet paper
That bespeaks of a lack of care and a willingness to be substandard
Even a small thing like I extended and the lady didn't do the right paperwork, so she had to come up  flights of stairs to get me (as phone didn't work) and instead of brining the paperwork for me to sign, she made me come down and do it
Again, lack of concern or even thinking
Why inconvenience me for your mistake

Date of stay April -18, 

My adult daughter was also traveling with me and we both had some pretty major issues with our room. But that is not the reason I am contacting you. I frequently stay in hotels as I have to travel to California from Arizona about every -6 weeks. I do like to stay in a Choice Hotel because I have found that the quality of the hotel is usually pretty consistent, and they are priced right, too. However, that was not the case with this stay! My issue is with GM of this homeland how I was treated by him after I filled out the survey I received regarding our stay there. I honestly answered it, as I do all surveys, and pointed out why we wouldn't be staying at this place again.And then I got an email back from the GM that was so unprofessional and offensive, that I think Choice Hotels should know what he said. The initial email is copied below:

Dear Pamela,
Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel. 
On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for failing to exceed your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you provided to make improvements to ensure we offer an exceptional experience for our guests in the future.
I would like to rebuff your review with my side explanation too.
We did not give you the wrong room but rather you went to wrong room yourself and it was clearly written on the key that we gave you. Your key worked for the room which had  beds which you requested. 
If you were not happy you could have told us right away the reasons and we would have given you other room  to make you happy but you chose to stay in the room and write bad review after staying in the room whole night which shows your BIAS and your agenda against us. We do offer very clean rooms with new linen and pillows nicely tucked in. The water in Blythe is hard water and if you know the effect of hard water on bedsheets you would have understood. We clean everything after the guest check out with Lysol/pine sol and do the laundry every day and your comment is unwarranted as you had biased view with out understanding but reaching to instant conclusion. As a motel owner why would I have a bad toilet with yellow water in it. Think about it. City of Blythe had done some water pipeline work and that is why there was yellowish water in the toilet which we had no control over. After we talked to City of Blythe Public Works Department which you can also call and confirm by talking to Suze to report also about bad water at (760)922-6611. For us customer happiness is very important and we go out of our way to help guest with their needs.
For your and our safety we keep our front door locked and do the business through our night window and this should not be a issue rather your understanding of the virus situation was needed. We are trying to protect you and us. I do not see anything wrong in that.
We are OK to have lost your business to motel  as we can not please everybody. After you checked out we had rented the same room to other couple. They were extremely happy with our service, our room and all linen and furnishing. 
We get many customers who stayed at Motel  and they become our repeat customers and gladly pay  or even  more dollars for the efforts we are putting in to our motel.
It appears from your review that you had came to our motel with an agenda to promote motel , which is OK. More power to you.

I am glad that you realize the past year has been hard for the hotel industry and people who stay at our place are coming back every time they travel on I-10. 
Sincerely,
Nikhil Shah &lt;&lt;

My reply back to him is next:

To: Nikhil Shah 
You should have stopped typing after your st paragraph, accepting the fact that your motel needs help. Instead you try to turn your back on me which is very unprofessional! Let me assure you that I have NO ""bias"" or ""agenda"" against you. I am actually offended that you said that. I really wanted to like your hotel, and it just didn't measure up. NO bias or agenda whatsoever! 

Regarding the room, I was very clearly told room  and repeated it back to confirm. I don't generally check the number on the key to the room number as I've never had reason to. You even apologized for giving us the wrong room number. So that is on you, not me!

The beds were made up the same in each room. So I had no reason to believe that another room would be different. And it was very late when we got there, and my daughter and I were both very tired. We had already unloaded our things from our car, and I didn't want to have to move all our stuff in search of another room. If you had better rooms, why didn't you just put us in one of THOSE rooms to begin with? 

And I do understand what hard water does, and there are water softening add in that can be used. But it wasn't hard water stains, the sheets weren't even really tucked in but kind of thrown on the bed and rumpled liked they'd been slept on. Perhaps you need to talk to your housekeeping about doing a better job?  

And perhaps you need to stop being so defensive and listen to your guests when they honestly tell you what they experienced. Again, I wanted to like your motel, I really did. But I'm sorry, it just wasn't what I've learned to expect from a Choice hotel. FAR from it. And over the past couple of years I have stayed in many motels/hotels as I have to travel to California from Arizona often. I leave good reviews if they are warranted, but I'm also honest when something is not right. I've not ever been berated for giving my honest review though. That is really uncalled for and I will be lodging a complaint with Choice hotels as a result of your offensive reply. &lt;&lt;

I do feel for people like him who are struggling as a result of Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns over the past year, however, that does not give him an excuse for his very unprofessional and offensive attitude over a negative review. The fact of the matter is, the review was very honest, and I was appalled at the condition of the room, as was my adult daughter, and it's the worst Choice Hotel I've ever stayed in. The GM had an excuse or accusation for everything, and emailed me twice more (he did apologize for offending me, but then turned around and said that I offended him and continued to try to defend the state of his hotel.) The room was WAY overpriced, as well. I do realize that the Rodeway Inn is a lower priced budget hotel, but this was so below my expectations, especially for the amount I paid for  night,  that I really felt something needed to be said.

If you need me to send you the rest of his communications, I am willing to do that. Honestly I didn't even read his last email as it started off the same way and was long and wordy and I really don't want to engage with this guy anymore. Thanks. I appreciate the additional points. :)

" I hate complaining but after staying at the Quality Inn Hotel in Montreal at  Herron Road for my quarantine stay Im disgusted. They tried to double charge my stay and then when I called to complain they completely denied it.

They have no social media I can reach out to them on. Calling has done me nothing, they only deny it. Wont be using here again. Hi my name is Leah Rowan Bloschichak I arrived in Canada on April st  and my confirmation number is  to get more into detail I was okayed by the Canadian government to go to my final isolation destination on the nd, so thats when I checked out. I had paid my hotel fees on March th and quite oddly a security guard had me sign off on confirmation of all payments as I was about to leave. I checked my bank account because I had to get a taxi, and noticed almost immediately my account was trying to process the same amount of money I paid back in March again from the Quality Inn. Obviously I was alarmed and called them where I was on hold for  minutes and actually had to call twice just to get a response from anyone. The lady told me she saw no such pending charges and had no idea what I was talking about. I said I was going to talk to my bank. I called my bank and they confirmed that the hotel was trying to charge me again and said to keep an eye on it because it was suspicious but they themselves could not do anything about it until the payment actually processed. I waited it out to see when it would go through, and the charge was cancelled I believe on Saturday. It was only then I noticed a new pending charge from a food delivery company for .00 also processing. Obviously like I said it cant be me because Im in quarantine still and ordering food is clearly not an option and the delivery service isnt even offered in Canada from what I can gather. The charge is still trying to process and Im worried someone from that hotel stole my debit card information. Im going to be in Canada for six months and to have this happen is beyond inconvenient and really crappy. There is no other places that could have taken my card besides the quality inn. This is the quality inn in Montreal located near the Trudeau airport address  Herron Road. Thank you for any help you can offer me!

Your hotel was not up to standards & now your hotel is tying up my funds.
This is disgusting at this point. 
My request is that the entire $364.45 charged on my CC be refunded. At this point, its the most courteous move your company can do given that your staffs response was oh well, nothing I can do, dispute it, then deny my request 
Andy Borrero & Amanda Rivera I look forward to your prompt response & resolution    Mind you, the adjustment confirmation email was sent to us April . That was  days ago & still nothing from comfort inn. This makes no sense. What is the point of the DM if its the same answer! 
If you truly dont have access to your own hotel chains, what the hell was the reason for the DM request if youre going to give me the same run around.
Furthermore, if the rd party has agreed to the adjustment, what gives your hotel the right to deny the request? 
If the rd parties resolution is to adjust the charge, why isnt the comfort inn abiding by the same rules? 
Your resolution/explanation does nothing for me. Your hotel received $364 for someone that didnt even stay at the hotel.

"booked under my husbands name IRVEN POLK, Booked a suite last minute and it was horrible!!!
Arrived to check in and the fire alarm went off and the front desk had to call the fire department..she was very nice but visibly shaken.

The shower rod was broken the shower had broked tiles and ugly patch job to the ceiling. 
The elevator had busted tiles and tiles missing. 
The sofa in the room was filthy, stains on the sofa and floor.
No hot water in the sink next to the coffee maker. 
No breakfast bar as advertised!!
The little girl working the front was totally overwhelmed with all as they were very short staffed.
The front desk gal ( Myriam)
Was very helpful and apologetic for the situation she was doing the best should could in a horrible situation.
She was having to clean rooms and handle the front desk.

This was in no way a SUITE with all the broken no functioning items.
Definitely NOT WORTH THE  $193.97,we paid...
When you travel you expect a great room for the money....
Its not like we booked a low budget hourly hotel but felt that way...
TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS EXPERIENCE AND ANGRY THAT WE WASTED OUR MONEY I HAVE PHOTOS TO PROVE HOW NASTY AND DISGUSTING THIS HOTEL WAS...

"My dad and I got banned from the Antioch, California Comfort Inn because we called them out on ripping us off and didnt like it. We have earned a badge of honor! From my dad Daniel Bridges, he is a diamond member with Choice Hotels. This was written on /12/2021 and is regarding the Comfort Inn in Antioch, CA.

Terrible customer service. Charged twice for room and no one can fix their error. Told not charges but holds which means pending... customer still can't access those funds. Told to see the night auditor after :00 pm when her shift starts. So I'm up late to deal with all the incompetence going on...and paying for my room as well.

Extra $2 charge for safe in room added to the incidentals charge...$2 not refunded with the incidentals charge...this is not posted to inform customers. Security person stated the owners can do anything they want. $2 extra for every customer?...nice gig!

Contacted which owns this place. Hospitality?...right. Sign of the times, though...money, money, money and the customer receives no service, even when the hotel makes an error. Plenty of employees to make reservations...no one to help with customer issues after booking. No accountability or responsibility.  Hard to trust any company anymore...look what we've become. 

Stay away if you can, though things aren't much different elsewhere due to corporate ownership and greed. The place is also loud with other patrons and terrible freeway noise and the nice-looking flooring is actually filthy. 

Greed, poor service, and incompetence are not the results of covid... they're institutionalized and accepted as how places do business. Really sad. We were there on /10 and unfortunately I cannot find the confirmation number. Thank you, I greatly appreciate it. I was meaning to add Joe that you are first that has listened and that means a lot.

"DO NOT EVER STAY AT THE COMFORT INN & SUITES AT THE PYRAMIDS IN INDIANAPOLIS, IN.!!!

This past Friday night (May th) my wife and I checked into this hotel not realizing that a Biker Gang from Detroit, MI was also booked there for the same night.  We later found out they had a block of + rooms and to say they were loud is an understatement!

Throughout the night this biker gang terrorized the entire hotel with their motorcycles, loud music, excessive drinking, yelling and fighting each other.  We got no sleep as we were afraid that this gang was going to break into the rooms of the other guest and we also felt trapped if we were to attempt to leave as we could be assaulted.  

In all my  years I have NEVER experienced anything like this while traveling throughout the US, Europe, and Asia.  And to have my wife with me made it worse as she has a heart condition and her nerves were shot.

Twice we called the front desk and was told ""we are sorry but there is nothing we can do"".    It was obvious that the people at the front desk were clearly out of their league and supposedly they called the police but we never saw any officers.  So nothing was done to calm the small scale riot and this went on until roughly :00am.

My wife and I got no sleep whatsoever.

The next morning I went to the front desk to complain and ask for a refund due to this situation.  The young lady at the front desk said her General Manager would have to authorize this and he wasn't in.  I asked when he would be in and she told me he'd be there at :00am.  So my wife and I went to get some coffee and attempt to enjoy breakfast (our nerves were still shot from the night before).  We came back at :00am and the GM was not there and she didn't know when he would be there.  I left my name and phone number for him to call me so we could discuss this.  

He never called, ever.

So on Monday (May th) I called the front desk of this hotel again and once again I got the run around.  So I decided to call Choice Hotels and spoke with  separate people in Customer Relations.  Both people apologized for the way we were treated at this hotel but said they could not offer a refund as the hotel would need to do this themselves.  They could offer me points for a free night some time later on, but that was the best they could do.

I felt that the LEAST anyone could do for us was to give us a refund of our room stay AND points toward a free night later on.  I was told that once I was given the points the matter would be considered ""closed"" by Choice Hotels and I felt that I was simply being brushed off.  I asked to speak with someone ""higher up"" and was given an email address to express these concerns, that I couldn't speak with anyone personally.

Remember, all I wanted was my room refunded and points for at least one free night.  I felt from what we had been through we deserved that much at least.

So today I FINALLY got to speak with the General Manager of this hotel.  His name is Jason.  He was very defensive and rude, and explained that he ""couldn't very well throw  rooms of people out of the hotel for their behavior since they were guest too"".  He said there was nothing they could do that night, and that since there is a Black Lives Matter movement going on in Indianapolis (yes these bikers were black), they and the police felt that their hands were tied.  So basically I was told that the lives and safety of all other patrons of this hotel didn't matter at all, and if I wanted to contact a lawyer ""good luck with that"".  

He then hung up on me.  

So I don't know if I will ever receive any sort of compensation from anyone at Choice Hotels, but I do know that if this is the way they show ""respect"" to their paying guest, it will snow in July before I ever stay at one of their properties ever again.

Please feel free to call me to discuss.  I believe I was on a recorded line on  separate occasions when I called Customer Relations yesterday to file this same complaint.  There are a lot of details on those recordings. Thanks for reaching out to me.  I will accept the ,000 points and am grateful that at least someone within your organization is willing to recognize this horrific event and is willing to do something for us here.  The hotel is refusing to do anything for us.

"We are currently staying here. There was something unspeakable on one of the bed skirts. There is often the smell of weed and fried food.

I contacted corporate via phone  days ago and theres still been no actions taken. Hi, Zaira - thanks for looking into this!

Hello, Zaira, and thank you for your response.

We are staying at  Weir Drive, Woodbury, MN . We checked in May th, with a checkout date of June nd. The confirmation number for our reservation number is . Our reference number for the complaint we called in two days ago is .

I brought the fact that it often smelled like weed and got very noisy on the fourth floor to a gentleman who was working the front desk. He shrugged, apologized, and said he would let the manager know. Since we paid for the month in full, we were told we could not change our reservations. 

Last Saturday, I stripped our beds in order to exchange our linen, and in doing so, exposed a part of the bed skirt that had been covered by the mattress. It had a large, crusty white stain on it, which I found disgusting. I stripped the beds of everything at that point, and brought the linens down to exchange.
I was told there were no clean blankets. We were told this daily. After three days, I gave up and bought blankets for our beds, then called and made the complaint via the number listed on your website.

Thanks for your attention into this matter.

Samantha Oh ok so another bullshit response.  Ive contacted them. And corporate. Yall are ridiculous and Im just going to keep talking about the giant semen stain I found on our bedding Hows that for satisfactory? Not worth the savings when the bedskirts come equipped with giant, crusty white stains that youre pretty sure are bodily fluids. Is that what you mean by spring showers?

Case #: 

I tried calling several times before arriving to see if they could accommodate an early check in, or allow me to use a table to work until my room was ready. Over  days, phone went unanswered. Upon arrival, the lobby was in disarray, messy, dusty, and empty. No one behind the front desk, phone ringing off the hook. Someone appears after  minutes and told me my room wouldnt be ready for several hours. 

I sat at a table to work on my laptop and I saw several cockroaches both dead and alive, the carpets were ripped and stained, and the table had smeared dried liquid on it, similar to blood. Place smelled like mold and had bucket in the corner to collect water dripping from ceiling. 

I heard a couple fighting and talking about bed bugs, how their bodies were covered in bites after only  night in the hotel among other issues. I went to cancel my reservation with the manager and tell him I no longer was going to check in, but he was no where to be found. Phone ringing off the hook again behind desk. I had to leave and connect to WiFi to work, so I couldnt keep waiting around. Waited another  minutes and left. 

Called customer service line  times, and all  times I was hung up on and never called back. Case #10265311

I have traveled the world and stayed in some very sketchy scenarios and I am not expecting luxury at a clarion. But this felt like something out of a movie because of how awful it was, and being flat out ignored & hung up on by your team has made this even worse. I cannot believe how difficult it is to get my money back ($98.17) or even a call back to discuss. -681-7296  DMed. I am not a member, and after being told by several different people that there is nothing you can do even though it is YOUR clarion hotel that is holding onto the funds, I do not want to become a member. I do not want points. I want my money back. I booked thru T-Mobile and they said the hotel has the money and wont release it. I cannot get in touch with the hotel because they will not answer the phone. So I go to you, and you OWN the hotel and cant get the money? How is this fair or acceptable? Im just shit out of luck because that hotel wont answer the phone to give me my money back? I dont want points. I want you or someone on your team to call me or randomly inspect that hotel which has not been even vacuumed in years, and tell the manager to send my money back. This is absolutely ridiculous and I genuinely am not going to just let that money go. Im sorry if Im getting aggravated, I know this isnt your fault. Its the individual hotels fault. But please, what measures can I take or how can you help me get my full refund that I think I deserve? So theres literally nothing you can do to get me my money back? At a hotel I didnt stay at because of bed bugs? This is genuinely insane lol why would I ever stay at one of your hotels again after a terrible experience and you not even being able to help resolve it? Thank you for absolutely nothing  The hotel literally does not answer the phone. How am I supposed to get them to give me my money back if they dont answer? Would you like to pay for a flight for me to get back to Orlando, walk into the hotel, hunt around for an hour (again) hoping someone appears being the desk and ask for it back? If youre thinking of staying at a  be prepared that if you find bed bugs theyll do absolutely nothing to help you get your money back besides say sorry  thanks for nothing!

We booked several Weeks in advance and were put in a handicap room at the end of the hall by the exterior door between two very loud families that let their kids scream and yell in the hall. Got woke up every morning at :30 or. Halls smelled funny and were stained. Inside the room was nice and clean. When I said something upon checkout the girl said you should have come and told
" you have a real problem at #QualityInn #Bradenton North I-75. A real problem. Staying at Quality Inn North I-75  th St Ct E, Bradenton, FL . Pretty sure I'm grossly overpaying at $200/night but I had no choice because it's Memorial Day weekend and my son has a baseball tournament here. We arrived just before pm to check in and girls at the front were having computer issues. I literally stood at the desk for  minutes while they tried multiple computers, all the while not giving me updates or options. After standing there a half hour with my wife and kids in the car, I suggested that I leave and come back. They said that was a good idea. I asked how long I should stay away. They said they had no idea. I suggested  minutes. They said they couldn't promise that would be enough time because they needed to call reservation support. I finally suggested they call me when they get it figured out. They said they would. After + minutes of driving my family around killing time,  I came back to find that my reservation had been resolved. I asked why they never called me and they said they did. I asked what number. They rudely said ""the one you gave us"". I again asked them to confirm the number and sure enough they wrote my number down wrong. The woman at the front desk who was at least acting like she somewhat cared had a name tag that said Tamie. The other girl had no name tag but was responding to the name Tiffany. Tiffany has a nasty attitude. At one point when I tried to ask a question,  she interrupted me and said ""Do you want to give us a minute?!?"" The lack of empathy and service was disheartening. Additionally why were they ok with me waiting more than an hour for a room that I properly reserved and was ready?  Why not put my family in the room and figure out the computer issue later? It's like this was a normal occurrence for them and I should just stand there and wait. Add to that the carpet in the room is so dirty that it's turned the bottoms of my socks black. And my ankles have been bitten multiple times laying in this bed,  but I don't even want to turn the light on to check. We will probably check out tomorrow a day early and just eat the $200 I paid for Saturday night. If I owned this property I would be embarrassed.

Reservation dates May ,  - May ,  Itinerary #72098906169698 Went ahead and decided to investigate what was biting me. There are bugs in the sheets and pillows. Here's one I got on video. This is disgusting. I want my money back. We had to be at a baseball tournament at :30. When finish today we are getting our stuff and driving home. We will then get up early tomorrow and drive back down. Why would you think the front desk staff would have any resolution given their attitude and lack of competence yesterday? We have checked out and expressed our concerns to no avail. I will get my money back for tonight's stay even if I need my lawyer involved. Zero chance of that. There will be $199 coming back my way. Don't want or need your points. You don't care enough to fix this at the corporate level. The property doesn't care enough to fix it at the local level. Time for next steps. I will not pay for a room that I couldn't use because your property has a bug infestation. I will tell the world though.  What's worse - this video of the bed bugs crawling in our pillows at  last night, or the fact that they don't care enough to do anything about it at the local level? #badhotel #badcustomerservice #UCLFinal is way better than these bed bugs at  You guys just don't get it ""Joe"". You're starting to sound like a bot. I'm going to get my money back. Not points. Your offers are insulting. I have done both Grettel. And plan to do much more. Keep your points. I'll be getting a refund.  You can burn your points. Just like in burning the bed bugs that traveled hom with me from your disgusting property.  You can burn your points. Just like I'm burning the bed bugs that traveled hom with me from your disgusting property.  You can burn your points. Just like I'm burning the bed bugs that traveled home with me from your disgusting property. There was a #CrackerBarrel next to the #QualityInn in Bradenton that had these awesome #BedBugs, and  still refuses to refund my money.  $50 Guft Card AND Free Bed Bugs. Still waiting for Choice to do the right thing here. So far they've offered me ,000 points.  How about a refund?    This video was from their property in Bradenton Florida  nights ago. Bed bugs INSIDE my pillow case. We checked out and they still charged us for our full stay. Their solution? ,000 rewards points. Like I will ever stay there again.   No refund here in Bradenton Florida after these bed bugs were in my pillow. Checked out early. They charged us full stay. No refund. Offered ,000 points.

"Choice Hotels won't do anything. They will just offer you rewards points. They still won't refund me my money from the bed bugs that were crawling in my pillow Friday night.  Tina Cordero-Torres if you have video you can upload to YouTube. That's what I did with these bed bugs that were creating inside my pillow at the Quality Inn in Bradenton Friday night. Choice Hotels I've been through it over and over again through your Twitter support team. Ask Joe, Grettel, Ed and Numas. None of them were willing to help. I'm sure you're no different. So instead I will just remind the internet every single day how disgusting your properties are until you refund me my money. Choice Hotels yes! That's the pre written response that Ed sent me yesterday on Twitter. You guys must have a whole library of pre written responses that sound you like actually care about your customers. That's efficient. See you tomorrow Helder. Don't let the bed bugs bite.  It's been a week. Still no reply to my multiple emails to the manager of the property. It's time for you to handle this at the corporate level. No one should have to pay to sleep with bed bugs inside their pillow case. My next calls will be to the BBB and the local health department. Here's video of what was crawling in my pillow in case you forgot me. It's been a week and I know there have been several more complaints about your disgusting properties since then. Kalila Chantelle' Peyton good luck. Worst company ever. Our carpet was so dirty it turned my socks black. It was a non smoking room but it reeked of smoke and air freshener. It took an hour for me to check in because their ""reservation system had a problem"", yet other people checked in fine while I waited. The girl at the front desk had a major attitude. And the best yet - I found bed bugs. 

Choice Hotels has bed bugs. And they have the worst customer service ever. And their non smoking rooms reek of cigarette smoke. And their carpets are so dirty they turn your socks black. And they take an hour to figure out how to check you in. And their front desk agents have horrible attitudes. And when you reach out to management they don't respond. And their online customer support agents cycle through a handful of canned responses and try to silence you with reward points. Soooo...not really excellent. Not just roaches. Bed bugs too. Choice Hotels if you're going to start filtering and deleting my comments, then I will just post more. All this can stop if your property manager responds to my  emails and refunds my money. But they don't care and neither do you.  Choice Hotels here is the problem Grettel. I will never stay at one of your properties again so those points are meaningless. You've also contradicted yourself. You see, the fact that you have a franchise agreement absolutely means that you can ensure that this hotel manager responds to me. That's the purpose of a franchise agreement - so that you (the franchisor) can guarantee that the property owner (the franchisee) operates according to your regulations. So either your franchise agreement doesn't cover room conditions and customer treatment, or you guys don't care enough about those things to actually enforce the agreement.  Quality Bed Bugs.  Choice Hotels has bed bugs and the worst customer service.  I agree with Lynn. And I have the video of the bed bugs to prove it. And the lack of customer service is just as bad as the filth. Tricia Bergmann Montelongo don't waste your time. They don't care. They will do nothing to make this right.  Worst hotel chain ever Sammie. I'm thinking of starting a group of people that Choice Hotels has screwed over. Zero customer service. I had bed bugs crawling in my pillow, checked out and went home early and they refuse to refund me. They just keep offering rewards points that I will literally never use. And I had to pay $200/ night for this dump because it was Memorial Day weekend.  Robert Royce garbage!  With their scripted responses. It's ridiculous.  Sammie Marie Medonic-Seabolt can't believe one of the hotel employees is harassing you on social media too. They should no longer have a job, but Choice Hotels doesn't care enough to take action on that either.  Starlena Holland unreal. This is the worst company I've ever dealt with.  Carol Murray that agent did you a favor. Book elsewhere. Choice Hotels has the worst properties and customer service, but the best bed bugs.  Michele Frick our carpets were so dirty they turned our socks black and we found bed bugs. We left. Still fighting for a refund.  Carolyn Thomas eager to see if you get refunded. We had bed bugs too. We left and they refuse to refund me at the corporate level and they refuse to respons at the local level.  Sharita Johnson lol. Grettel using another of Choice Hotels pre written responses. Meanwhile, I can't get a response to my  emails about the filth and bed bugs we encountered.  Dang. Laney got two responses.  Meanwhile I'm on email number six to talk about the filth and bed bugs we encountered. ""Yikes!""  I love your fake shock Jendy. As though you guys don't get comments like this every day. This is who you are. You are a chain of filthy, bug infested hotels, manned by employees with terrible attitudes and absolutely zero customer service. Own it. Same here. These bed bugs crawling inside my pillow case wasn't the worst part of my stay, if you can believe that. Michele Frick Quality Inn Bradenton FL

Marcia J Compton Cook the carpet at our Quality Inn was so dirty it turned our socks black and we found bed bugs in our pillow. We left early and I can't get them to refund me at the corporate level and can't get them to reply to  emails at the local level.  Tonya Stone they are the worst.  In case their was any doubt, here's one of the bed bugs I found crawling inside my pillow. Debbie Smith Hufford totally unacceptable. So is the inability of their customer service to resolve complaints. I'm on week three and email number  trying to get something done about the filth and bed bugs that we had to deal with. Nothing but pre-written responses and rewards points offers. Their points are meaningless because I will never stay there again. Nothing is simple with them. Except bed bugs in your pillow. It was pretty simple to get those. Choice Hotels uh oh. Liz is getting agitated.  Mick Gordineer % So frustrating. Read the comments on their posts. You're not alone.

They said they'd call when they got it figured out but they never called. The attitude we got from the desk clerk was embarrassing. The bed bugs in our pillow were too.  I'm right there with you on the petty. I'm  weeks in on trying to get Choice Hotels to do anything about the awful stay we had. You're not alone. We had bed bugs in our pillows, filthy carpet, no wi fi and a horrible staff.  weeks later corporate deflects back to the property manager and the property manager has ignored my  emails. I will go full on King Petty over this before I will ever let it go. I've gotten all of their pre written responses here but no action. You actually got my favorite pre written response ""Oh no. It does not sound right.""  Oh it sounds right. It sounds like almost every other Choice Hotels experience on here.  Brian Schuch they're ""equally frustrated"". They won't do anything about it, but we can rest better knowing that they're frustrated.   years of bed bugs and poor customer service.  Dwayne Lock Read the comments on their posts. You're not alone. We had bed bugs in our pillows, filthy carpet, no wi fi and a horrible staff.  weeks later corporate deflects back to the property manager and the property manager has ignored my  emails.

Mick Gordineer yep. And I will never use their points because I will never stay there again. They say only the property manager can refund me, but the property manager has ignored  emails.  Lynn Denlinger couldn't agree more!  Mike Carroll ""Oh no!"" LOL. I love how Jendy acts so surprised. They literary hear these stories everyday because this hotel chain is trash.

"Hi. I'd like to speak with someone about a recent stay I had at a comfort suites in Brenham. I went through last minute travel because they had a cheaper rate than that of the choice website or calling direct to the hotel. Will the confirmation from their booking suffice? I stayed at a Comfort suites in Brenham, Tx check in was May  check out was May rd I had two rooms, one under Aaron Bunch and one under Sarah Bunch I checked into the hotel in Brenham Texas I had a horrible stay I wound up spending four hours having to clean my own hotel room. The general manager there is refusing any sorts of refund. And I've already spoken to your guest services agent, named roger, who has told me that you guys have absolutely no authority over the individual hotels as they are individually franchised. You have no way to enforce your lowest price guarantee, as I found a lower price, and that the best he could do is to offer me points to stay at another hotel. Those of you that travel, or those of you looking for hotels to stay in. Do not stay in any  Because if you have a bad experience, they are absolutely helpless and unable to help and can do nothing to get your refund other than to offer you points to stay elsewhere Jendy- I appreciate the offering the compensation of points, but in all of my  years of hospitality experience I have never run into a corporate chain that couldnt process refunds. When I worked for IHG if a customer contacted corporate regarding a refund, the hotel was contacted and if corporate deemed it appropriate then corporate issued the refund and then charged the franchised hotel for the refunded charges. Obviously Choice doesn't handle the situation that way. While the offer of k points is generous two nights stays doesnt cover the two rooms that I had for two nights or offer compensation for the + hours that my wife and I spent to clean both of these hotel rooms. I have sent an email to  with picture attachments. I look forward to a follow up. ,000 points. And do you have the contact information for the franchisee? Btw I had to speak with Rick the manager there because I was charged for the incidental charges and he told me the reason why he didn't give me a refund is because I gave him a bad review. Just adding more fuel to that fire of the type of franchisees that you have in your chain. That you know as long as I would have kept my mouth shut and not blowing the whistle on the fact that he runs a crap hotel. This is complete garbage And to be honest I booked two rooms for two nights, if you wanted to make it right after all this non sense, if cost ,000 point to stay at this hotel for one night. On points so ,000 points would refund the entire stay on points. ,000 points is only one room, one night So I'd say that ,000 points is fair. The local management will do absolutely nothing because I've contacted corporate. They will not even provide the owners information. I feel my request for ,000 point is reasonable, I did not earn points for this stay and ,000 point is at least one night for two rooms at another property, not the two night for two rooms that I had at this stay in question Sorry ,000 points would cover two. Rooms for one nignt Night The hotel management refused to do anything, direct quote was ""I was going to offer you a refund, but you left a bad review"". So the manager refuses to give me any money back, and as corporate, you're telling me that one, all you can offer is points, but not even the points to cover the stay which would be comparable to a refund of the stay... It's as if I'm being punished by the hotel management because I contacted corporate. I didn't even get points for the original stay... How about points for the original stay which what I should have regardless, and k extra, which is equal to refunding one night for two rooms. That's really the best you can do? ,000 points, that's only one room one night, I stayed two rooms two nights, and for whatever reason, I'm assuming because of the third party booking, I didn't get points for my original stay. I will take the k points. My choice privileges account is AVB9604 The local hotel manager wants me to go in and change my reviews and give shining reviews for his hotel in order for him to give me any sort of points or compensation and there's nothing for me to change because I simply stated that I had a bad State and that he has refused a refund or points. So I will take your far subpar offer to at least get some compensation. I have a hotel stay coming up next week and can use at least one free night so I might as well get at least one free night back. But I will not stop posting my review and I will not stay at another choice property. I don't even know how I would possibly begin to change or update my review. I really feell that I should at mimimum be credited k points per room. I had two rooms on my stay, so that would be the k points. I am on the phone with guest relations currently, and have been told that I can only get the k for one room. So why is it that we can't do k for EACH room. I have two different reservations. I find it incredibly hard to believe that the ""best"" that you can offer is k points. There has to be a way to do better.","Jendy, a guest at Choice in Brenham, Tx, was staying at a Comfort suites hotel. She had two rooms, one under Aaron Bunch and one under Sarah Bunch.

"Hello Clarion Hotels,

Today we had disappointed reaction from a hotel in Sweden Stockholm. Due to the COVID rules and regulations we were not allowed to travel to Sweden or Finland the last  months .

In the past we received a gift card for  night for  persons en now was the time to use this.

The reactie was its expired so you can not use this!
I was so disappointed and knowing that we life in the Netherlands  and that is the reason that we didnt use the gift card. Also no hotel in the Netherlands.

"Seriously y'all, do not stay here unless you like being robbed and lied to. They are not pet friendly either so don't fall for it. I've done that several times. Yall keep telling me that you're all individually owned and yada yada. Then you offer me points to a system that I can only use if I stay at another one of your locations. This business puts out false advertisements and then once they have your money, they come up with different rules that are not stated anywhere on the website. Someone please tell me why I would wanna stay at a hotel that I wouldn't trust to hold a penny? No accountability in the middle of pandemic. This is literally the most unprofessional business I have encountered during the entire pandemic. 

Transparency goes a long way. Kaylee Smith pure greed! I honestly don't know how they stay open. So many businesses buckled due to covid restrictions, yet this business never took a single precaution, and the rooms only get cleaned once every  weeks. It sounds like every single manager at each location treats people the same way. ","Do not stay here unless you like being robbed and lied to, says Kaylee Smith.

I stayed at a choice hotel in Frederick Maryland. Worst experience I ever had. Bathroom was infested with ants. Went there for the indoor pool and the miniature golf since I had my grandson. The pool supposedly was broke but yet the day we were leaving it was up and running with little to no work the lady couldn't find the clubs for the miniature golf. Ice machine was broke on our floor. The refrigerator in our room froze our drinks. The toilet paper holder was broke so the toilet paper just fell right on the floor.  Our lamp was broke on the left side of the bed. The digital clock made a humming noise do we had to unplug it. The lobby was very attractive but we got to our building the carpet had holes stains very dirty. I contacted the desk at least  times about the ants and they each time and they would be up in a few minutes and never showed up. The last day we could not get a shower because the ants were all in the bathtub it was disgusting. I don't know if they're all like this but the one in Frederick Maryland was terrible. The only thing they would do to for me with give me points that won't even cover a one night stay. I spent two nights there and I should have really left on the second day but we got in late and I didn't feel like packing up n driving home. It's so sad that the staff continue to lie to me and say they would be right up and they never showed up. Terrible experience. Donna L King a few years back I went out to Corbin Kentucky and I almost stayed at the Econo Lodge in Corbin thank God I didn't. I recently stayed at Econo Lodge in Frederick and it was awful. Not very clean a big gap in the door and the bathtub was so old and worn my grandson would not even get in it yo take a bath because he thought it was dirty. I will never stay at an Econo Lodge again. Also I don't know if they housed homeless people there because that's what it looked like to me and the cops were continuously there. I was there  minutes and a cop showed up  Doors Down and then when I was arriving back later that evening there were six cop cars around the corner at another room. Won't  never stay at one again.

The name of the hotel Clarion Inn Frederick Event Center. I did talk to someone today after I arrived home and they told me they would give me some points and the points they gave me arent even enough to rent again for one night of course not at that same Hotel again. It's a shame because it looked like a really nice hotel it had an indoor pool that was broke it had a miniature golf for the kids that they couldn't find the equipment to and had a lot of ants like I said. My grandson and I were touring and Gettysburg and we chose to stay at that hotel because it looked impressive because of the pool and things like that but it was a big like they own the entire weekend especially being invaded by ants in the bathroom. The main important thing that really bothers me is how I approached the front desk at least five times each day begging them for some help and they kept telling me somebody would be right up and they blatantly lied.

"Hello,

I am looking for contact information for a complaint. I booked a weekend stay my member number is  KCP3450  conformation #20368425. 

I am HIGHLY disappointed with this suite and if not for the unavailability of a closer hotel on such short notice I would not be staying. 

Following complaints: . Outside was not presentable, trash and debris all over the parking lot and entrance. 
 . Appears to be multiple drug exchanges going on outside. 
 . Long check in line and only one person working front desk. 
 . Swarm of flies in dining area. 
 . Smoking odor throughout the hallways 
 . King suite only has one television with no channel guide. 
 . Kitchen area has no utensils or even dish soap. No point in having a kitchen with no dishes or silverware. 
 . Air does NOT work. Room never cooled down despite air being on  degrees. 
 . Sheets were stained and or had holes
 . Only provided  towel and face towel. Asked multiple times for more which were not available. Towels appeared to be dirty. 
 . Asked for linen for pullout couch, none were available. Given one blanket that front desk had to find because he stated it was his first night. 

Overall, this room was not up to the standards that are represented on the website. This is highly disappointing and frustrating as we booked this hotel for location and Comfort as stated in the name but we have been everything except relaxed! Chris Garrido it was the worst ever! Literally not safe from all the extra traffic hanging outside at all hours. Thought we were in a safe location but it definitely wasnt!","Guests have been disappointed with this suite.

To clarify, when I called the hotel on Friday,  it was just to confirm that I was understanding the fees correctly and would only be charged for one night. 

The man on the phone told me he could just cancel it then and that any pending charges would just fall off, as he said nothing is charged until check-in. 

When it wasn't showing pending on my account Sunday,  I assumed it had done what he said,  but woke up this morning to it saying it cleared yesterday and any pending charges from yesterday clearing after. 

I called the hotel this morning and the man said something about the charges would be reversed and to give it a few days and then call back... but I'm having a hard time with trusting it after this mess,  especially once the overdraft charges hit   Thank you so so much!","Abigail Freeman made a reservation last week and then called the location on Bentonville, AR and asked if their pool was open.

First steps through the door  a disgusting muggy smell . The place smelled like stinky feet.  We tought it could of been just the entrance. Well that wasnt it . We walked towards our room through the hallway our room was #117 . The smell was horrible again like  thousand sport athletes shoes. Well now in our room I sat to use the restroom and the toilet seat rocked side to side .That scared the shiet out of me. Well now we go to the pool. The indoor pool all windows closed the humidity in there made it hard to breath . I tried opening a window to sit beside it and watch my son while he used the pool. The windows were barely functional hard a hard time getting it open . So on top of the pool there is a vent on the roof. That was full of mold. There was covid postings throughout those were inside sheet protectors all full of mold . The sofa in the room was all dirty .Overall the hotel was disgusting  .Never will I ever stay here again. I honestly never stayed in a place with all this going on. I have never found a hotel with a horrible smell period. And yet a charge of $278. Woow .honestly this place was worth about $14.95 a night .I am not even kidding  some director or supervisor should have a visit up there.",Minocqua Wisconsin Quality Inn was a nightmare.

Multiple people told us this place was disgusting with no towels or toilet paper .  Them floor was so dirty it had spills all over it and dust was everywhere. Christmas decaf was still up.  We went to room after stairs to clime because elevator was broken and the stairway was dim because of lighting issue. Our room was so dirty with dog hair and fleas or bed bugs on bed. With a pandemic I cant expect my grandmother who is  to stay in these conditions so we left . The front desk told me I could get refunded only by calling the customer service number then customer service told me that only he could refund me.  I was lied to by this man , because he knowing knew that he wasnt going to refund me.  I want refunded I dont want points i will never be back to your hotels again. I dont care if its a gift card I just need my money back please.  This is a pandemic time and your hotels put my families safety at risk how shameful. Thank you. I have a case #  but no one has gotten back to me . I am a single mother and I dont want points I just want my money back . I wont be on vacation again for a long time . The manager told me I could call customer service and get my money back and I later found out that he was to do it and lied to me . That was my savings for my trip wasted . I had to book another hotel I would just like to be credited . Please I hope you can help me . That hotel can then release my information or I can release to you my credit card information for crediting.  I will never be able to use points .

Again the individual owning it lied to me and said your customer service would refund me because his screen was grayed out therefore I need refunded. I cant use points I am a single mother this was my only trip that I saved for and I need that money back in my account for my family.

How could you ethically take my money and bend me over for the most stressful and awful experience #findabetterChoice  definitely will be filing a complaint with the local BBB regarding this bait and switch.

Asking myself why I trusted you with my stay after being on road  hours  worst night of sleep ever. Had over k worth of equipment and put into the smallest room, no fridge and had to sleep on the floor rather than the suite I booked  apparently when you use the app you send wrong information to the hotel.... Definitely I must reconsider my platinum status as meaning ""not worth getting it right""   years being in business and you have customers who have to sleep on your floors.  dollars and wasn't worth getting it right....  been nearly  hours and still no response from your customer service team about paying for a stay after you altered my reservation.... #awful #youdontcare  Confirmation  Missoula Mt /12    I have dm all the requested information  sent the requested information. But still no response I am so disappointed in your local management They offered  dollars, And they told me if I didn't like the stay I should have just checked out How in anyway is that manager in charge of your name brand? Being told I should just check out made me feel so uncomfortable that I am definitely gonna make sure local media is made aware that local hotel definitely discriminates again minority owned business owners by wanting to have them check out of the hotel despite paying for the rooms in advance Once we check out tomorrow I will provide you additional information about our stay, the rude phone call details and any potential after actions taken by the hotel/ management team &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Complaint: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am rejecting this response because:
It is definitely a sad response to use the excuse of ""we tried calling"". I've provided phone records and voicemail records to show no phones calls were received not any voicemails left. Additionally no emails were sent as well in regards to the attempts to contact me. 

Additionally, when speaking with Management the morning of I was told that the issue that caused this was that corporate Choice sent the wrong reservation. This now a complete different story given by the GM. 

I also got a call from the gym who told me that if I didn't like the response of free points. That I could check out and leave. Given that attitude and lack of professionalism and complete disregard for my experience of having to sleep on the floor as a paying customer that is why I must reject your response. Maybe that given my Hispanic last name, or the type of business we have as The Amador Group LLC the staff at Sleep Inn Missoula made the conscious decision to give away our suite, make our team share  bed and sleep on the floor. 

Your phone call to tell me water and electricity are not free and I used the service is your reason for not making this right was in my lifetime the worst experience I have had as a platinum member. 

I didn't get what I reserved and planned to have. The only thing that would make this right now would be a refund of the night, an apology by the management at this location, and the feedback given to the ownership of this franchise about the management handling of my issue.
Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ruben Amador That was my response to the BBB complaint  It definitely is not. I am now having to dispute the entire charge with my bank I now know better not to trust the Choice Brand given you will end up pointing at the independent owner. 

If any of my instructors who wore my brand was anyway outside of the standards I set they wouldn't be instructors. My brand and my logo means something to me After I dispute what should I do You realize that your offer of k points was an equivalent of about $50 when I had the worst customer service experience and paid .1k My account may say diamond but it feels like I'm in the trash/chopped liver category","Missoula Sleep inn changed my reservation to a single bed room.

Steven, your reservation is confirmed.
Confirmation Number:  Thank you for the offer, I just took a look in my area looking at different facilities for the wife and I.  The decent looking ones that she would probably be delighted with the free night is ,000 points, would something like that be feasible? Thanks again. Thats fine I guess..

"Just called and complained about Quality Inn West in Amarillo. 
I have photos and videos that would make you vomit. Jake helped me and signed me up to get points enough to stay at another location on our way back through. Then said you have  points (I have no idea where to sign in or how to use them) but its  to stay. 
So I feel like we are out that hotel cost, and wont be booking with you all anytime soon. 
I wish you allowed videos on here because everyone needs to see this hotel and what its like. It should be condemned.  Hey, its Andi. If I can send pics I will. Youd cry for us. 
I was really praying for some refund or a night stay at nice place honestly. I got  hours of sleep and woke up worried about bed bugs or lice. 
It was so bad.  
Im telling you.. I wouldnt wise an enemy to stay here. I shared it publicly on my FB and my friends were saying leave. We cant just book another place and be out $$

I didnt shower. We are all exhausted and I feel so bad my kids experienced this. 

Any help, or pics I can email, all would be welcome. Choice Hotels I sent the info  I was able to send pics! Here is the room in its glory. Arrived June th 
James Blake Calhoun 
my husband reserved it under Hotels.com Choice Hotels all info sent. And videos and pics.  Chris Garrido darn. I feel like my case is going to just sit now.   Honestly Joe, Ive gone through the hotels for  points and seeing the hotel we mentioned above is listed for  and on there I have zero faith that we wont be put in a similar situation. Especially reading other reviews.  
I even looked at the other higher ones and there is just bad reviews all over these hotels you offer. 
I wish someone would just refund us. 
That would be nice and appreciated. Wed rather put that into a nice room at a hotel with reputable reviews. Just give me the highest points you can. Honestly. Just make this worth the headache it was. You keep going up, so go as high as you can. Wed appreciate it. A great hotel is ,000. 
I know we need to be reasonable here but the ,000 to ,000 are the best of better. 

Help us. Yes. That would be wonderful

"Im a diamond Choice member. I have issue with your hotels NOT giving the welcome points at check in; never ask for the  gift at check in which is usually a bottle of water and crackers.  Choice Hotels , Ed, I usually call member services and give the time frame and request that all stays within that period be investigated. I then get the points added. My complaint, I have to do this every  months for my stays because the hotel Mgmt do not want to add those points! One hotel told me they are charged for the points and thats why they do not select the welcome points at check in. Its not just one particular hotel, its the majority that do not add these points.  Its a hassle for me to have to keep calling and its usually long phone call everytime explaining the issue and the dates. Ticket is submitted and a follow up call is suppose to happen but I have to do the follow up, no one from Choice ever calls back. Please check why Im NOT receiving all the welcome points at check in. With all my reservations, I add a comment to add my welcome points. You can check my reservation comments!

I made changes to my reservation to just stay /16/21 to /17/21. I received a new email showing the changes and was the same reservation number.
When we arrived on the th the gentleman that checked us in said there was a problem trying to get it to work and tried again. It didn't work so he had to manually type in  new reservation. No big deal. Once he was done the price had jumped up $12 maybe. Wasn't happy but again no big problem. Once everything was set and good to go we went up to our room. When we got in the TV was on, kinda weird but ok. Then I found a receipt from the previous person on the desk. My fiancee said the beds didn't look freshly made. I thought they did. It wasn't till her granddaughter turned and seen dirty towels on the bathroom floor still.
I marched downstairs to let the gentleman know. He had somewhat apologized and looked for another room to which he said there wasn't any. They would get the one we had cleaned as soon as possible and give a discount. 
At that moment I was mad. I had been driving for  plus hours and ready for some rest. I told him to just refund my money. He didn't even try to find another hotel near by for us. I had to find another which was another  minute drive from that one. Plus what I had planned got ruined because we had to drive  minutes to another hotel and it already getting late so we had to scrap the days plans. 
I stayed at two other choice hotels that week before going to this one and they were all great clean and had wonderful people. This Rodeway Inn was just disgusting. And the people were just sorta rude.

i called two days ahead of my reservation to make SURE i had early check in at noon as opposed to the usual , because i would be flying in early.

i dont know what can be done about this but i had to say something. this is ridiculous. thank you
theres been many other grievances that i have since ive been in the room, mostly due to cleaning issues. (the room smelled so strongly of bleach my eyes were watering)
as i was sitting in the lobby for  hours, i overheard the manager telling multiple people who had major complaints that there was nothing that could be done, so id rather just directly share this with corporate.","i called two days prior to my reservation day to arrange for early check in, i show up and am told they have no record of that call. now im sitting in this lobby for the next HOURS. despite overhearing them say on phone which rooms they had ready, i keep being told they cant get me into a room until pm, another hours from now.",iââm sitting in hotel lobby till pm phone call,"The Quality Inn in Orlando FL is NOT reputable at all. i called  days prior to my reservation day to arrange for early check in, i show up and am told they have NO record of that call. now im sitting in this lobby for the next  HOURS.  hello, im messaging regarding  your response tweet about the Orlando Quality Inn location.

" it is AM in Norfolk Virginia. We had reservations to check in tonight, but something got screwed up. The people in customer service on the telephone found us another hotel,  minutes away. That was sold out too. I don't know where my family will sleep tonight. [1/x] Left home this morning ready for my vacation. We had a reservation at a  location--a Comfort Suites in Newport News. The reservation was from /26 thru /1. But when we got there, the location said they had us checking in the next day - /27. We went right... [2/x] online to show the very dismissive woman behind the counter what the  website said. She wouldn't even look at it. She silently printed out a piece of paper that showed a /27 check-in date and wouldn't engage us in further conversation. So we called customer... [3/x] Service (it's about :30P) for the first  minute hold of the evening. They arranged a night at a really rundown Econolodge, but at this point we were like FINE. Just give us a place to stay. So off we went. After the  minute drive, we are just pulling into the hotel... [4/x] parking lot when my wife's phone rings. It was that Econolodge they had just booked us in saying ""sorry, we don't have anything for you either. Better luck next time"", only without the ""better luck next time"" part. This time my wife calls the  customer svc... [5/x] number so SHE can hold for over a half hour. At ONE THIRTY AM, we finally have a hotel to go to.

[6/x] Lodge,  gave my wife a bunch of reward points so we didn't have to pay for this hotel. But when my wife asks the SECOND agent for this same courtesy at this new hotel, the  agent said no, couldn't do it. We had to PAY for this new hotel for the... [9/9] man, I've gotta tell ya,  getting this $371 dollar charge off my card should only the first thing we get tomorrow morning when my wife calls tomorrow. I've seen some Sh!+ shows in my life, but this takes the cake. Two nights later, my  nightmare still rages on. Best new development? At the gouging Econonolodge location, the RECEIPT I got said $321.xx, but they CHARGED my credit card $371.xx - exactly $50 more. WTF? Where did that other $50 go? On the phone now. Wish me luck!  I'll do it. FYI, I've been on hold for ""customer service"" for One hour forty-five minutes. I also received a similar reply on a Facebook page, about an hour ago. I am going to DM right now, as this is taking time from my vacation. Hello! The reservation is in my wife's name, Jennifer Miller.

"I had always had great experiences at Choice Hotels until a recent visit to Charleston. It was so bad we left after the first night when we had booked for two. They hadnt cleaned the room at all. There was no toilet paper. Then we found out the toilet wouldnt flash. Drug dealers were right outside our door not even trying to hide what they were doing. I was very shocked the Choice Hotels would allow this. I travel a lot and had became used to updated, clean and safe rooms.  This is the hotel we stayed at. Im not looking for a  star hotel when I book a room, but up until this stay I had always been happy with the Choice hotel chain. Although they are doing some updates, this place is by far not up to standards with other Choice hotels Ive stayed in all across the country. I know everybody is short handed, but theres no excuse to not clean the rooms, have toilets that wont flush and have drug deals taking place in broad daylight. We paid for two nights, but could only stay for one because of this. We overpaid at that because they had a sign up advertising a construction special of $65. We paid over $200 for two nights.

Dont come here if you want to sleep. You can hear thru the walls. Had to call office twice so to noise at  am. Sounded like they had about  people in one room. Kids running up and down the stairs crying screaming banging on doors at all hours. Cars parked in parking lot with music and people all around them. Office says when they come over here they dont see or hear anyone. I guess they would rather cater to a bunch of kids in one room disturbing the families. This place seemed more like a party hook up hang out. Didnt feel safe with all the parking lot loitering. This hotel was anything but quality. Paid for  nights had to get my money back after the first. I really think I should get a refund for both nights.  Never again will I stay here.  Very disappointed. Thank you responding.

"Stayed twice  weeks ago. Was I supposed to get a gift card Stayed at main stays in Houston twice this summer,  the people who work there are great! The only Hotel I will book in Houston.  They don't have a hot breakfast and said they will probably never go back to it. Choice said we don't qualify for gift card because it has to be  different hotels,  not stays. I was already spoke with someone,  they said the hotels have to be different each stay.

"Hello, I am currently staying at your Tuscaloosa Downtown location and experienced a problem.  One of the main reasons I booked this hotel was because it advertises an indoor heated pool.  We are celebrating my son's birthday and he loved to swim so it was a selling point for me.  I went as far as calling the hotel this morning to find out pool hours so I could schedule our day accordingly.  We get here and get ready for the pool, and once we get there we find the water extremely cold.  The kids try to go in but it's just to cold.  My husband goes and asks the front desk about the heated pool feature and is informed it is not working.  No one mentioned this before our arrival as we would have canceled and booked elsewhere, and the lady I spoke to about pool hours just  hours before our arrival didn't mention it either.  Again, this was supposed to be part of the birthday celebration and one of the main reason we chose this hotel over others in the area. Name: Johnny Estrada
Hotel: Comfort Inn and Suites Downtown
Address:  Jack Warner Pkwy, Tuscaloosa, AL 
Dates: July nd to rd
Confirmation number: 

Again, I called :20am on the day of our arrival to confirm the pool was open and ask for pool hours.  No one mentioned the pool would not be heated and thus too cold to use.  It was such a disappointment for everyone as it was part of our celebration that weekend. Numas, I understand that some amenities are not available during Covid.  I would like to know if you took time to look into the situation before throwing out the Covid excuse.  I would assume you did since I was asked to provide all the details of our reservation in the previous message.  The front desk told us the heating feature of the pool was broken.  It was not due to Covid.  It was something that could have been brought up long before our arrival, or even when I called to inquire about the pool specifically. ,000 does not help at all since I can't use those points without first spending more money in order to earn more points.  I think a partial refund of our stay would be a much more reasonable solution in this situation. Hello, I was working on creating an account to get those points added to. Ok, I created an account under my name.  The member number is YXE4901.  However, I don't know if there is a way to add the points for this past weekend's stay and the ,000 extra point to that profile. Ok, the ,000 can be added to Johnny's account.    Hamilton Ave

" what kind of scam are you running where you allow people to book rooms and upon arrival there are no more rooms?! Conf:  Guest name: Shayeeda Bush Location:  Broad St Building A - Clarion, Delaware Water Gap, Pennsylvania , 
United States Saturday July rd I arrived at the location, I was already charged and was told my room was not available. I was told that I should not have been able to make the reservation. It was at this point :30am and there was no where else for me and my sister to go. The front desk associate said he would make a note and Im like theres no note to make I need a place to sleep. The supervisor never showed his face and apparently was cleaning a room for a family that was waiting for a room for  hours with their two children one being an infant. A room was eventually found and I slept for a few hours with my sister in a full size bed and both of us are ft tall and above so it was not the best option but we had no choice at that point. At :10 am because am was check out and I was not made aware. The door was banged on to ask me to check out and hurry up before I would be charged another day. There was also some random man in a wheelchair rolling around the lobby and smoking out front. It was very odd and didnt make me feel safe. I assume he was staying at the Rodeway Inn connected to the clarion. When I called one of your representatives all they did was call the hotel that I was standing in. There was no assistance provided. I was told to call back if I needed mode help and to be clear was never helped. I asked the representative to call me back in  minutes to make sure it was resolved and they never did. Just an overall frustrating and disgusting experience. I asked the hotel for a refund of some kind and they said they would consider it. I dont believe them. I will never patronize this brand again. I simply want my full refund from that establishment. I have no desire to patronize this brand anymore. I cannot chance that this will ever happen again. That makes this situation even worst. Theres nothing you can do about this location and their incompetence but your name is on it.",Shayeeda Bush was charged for her room at the Rodeway Inn in Pennsylvania.

"Staying at Quality Inn in Elizabethtown, KY right now. Please contact me regarding some very concerning problems with this property. Safety concerns for patrons and employees. Sorry I am just getting back to you.  rooms were booked for our family of  through Travelocity. Confirmation #31702454 and #31700949 under the name Jessica Shelton.  Check-in July ,  Check-out July , .  We arrived for check-in after pm on July  and were informed that one of our rooms was not ready. That was ok, we waited in the other room until it came available (about an hour). Later that night, while staying in room , the door became locked. We could not exit the room. The electronic mechanism is faulty, and the front desk attendant came to open the door. It took her several minutes but she finally got it open, and immediately said ""I told them to block this room."" When we closed the door again, the same happened. Locked in again. During this time, my son (11) noticed that the hotel room (210) did not have internal sprinklers.  So we were locked in a room without sprinklers, and with a window that did not open.  I shouldn't need to tell you what may have happened in the case of a fire. The fact that the hotel GM and employees KNEW this was a problem and continued to book the room in criminal.  If a fire occurs in that building Choice Hotels would be liable for deaths. I have already contacted the Fire Dept. of Elizabethtown, KY and encouraged them to do a full investigation. This extreme danger is more than enough for Choice (Quality Inn and Suites) to deal with currently, that I even hesitate to mention the room smelled of smoke (non-smoking reservation) and was quite dirty.  Certainly unacceptable in my mind. Thank you for the reply. However, I did not write this with any expectation of favor.  I simply do not want a tragedy to take place and innocent lives to be lost.  This is a correctable problem, and that is all I want.  I'm sorry that points and rewards are not what I am after. I do not feel safe traveling to a Choice Hotel property with my family.  We do not travel very often, and hope this is not normal practice.  I value ethical and moral action well beyond rewards and points.  I truly hope this is corrected soon and that a tragedy does not take place. Weve just had a continuing poor experience. After telling us we would not be charged for our room, we were charged for two rooms. Again, completely unacceptable. Now I am asking for something. I need the charges refunded. Im afraid that the GM and hotel owners are now upset that we alerted Choice and local fire officials of their potential criminality and are charging us because of that. Please refund our charges. And now the hotel has charged us for a third time. This is completely unacceptable. All  charges of $149 each need to be refunded immediately. The practices of Quality Inn and Suites in Elizabethtown, KY are entirely unethical and immoral, and likely illegal. Please correct the myriad of problems. We have already disputed the charges with our bank. I would really like the ethical problems we've encountered to be addressed.  There seems to be a grand moral failure from Quality Inn, Choice Hotels, the local GM, and the local owner (Gopal Krishna Inc). Ethical problem #1 - the fire hazards and lack of sprinklers.  Ethical problem #2 - booking rooms that are known to be dangerous to guests.  Ethical problem #3 - asking us to pay full price for a single room after we've had all these problems.  Ethical problem #4 -  days later charging us for a total of  rooms ($450).  Ethical problem #5 - the nonchalant attitudes of everyone regarding these ethical problems. Sorry, but I'm not quite convinced by the series of pre-programmed responses.  Honestly, the most appropriate course of action is to close the Quality Inn and Suites in Elizabethtown, KY until deemed safe by the local fire marshal. Still nothing on the moral failings then? Other than you ""understand my point of view""?  I've done everything I can to prevent a disaster.  Why are Gopal Krishna Inc and Choice Hotels not taking this seriously, or taking responsibility?  People are being locked into their rooms! With no way to escape and no sprinkler system.  But you ""understand my point of view"" so everything is ok then.  It is quite obvious that Choice Hotels and Gopal Krishna Inc do not care about this problem and potential tragedy.  This is my final message.  Feel free to reach out to take some responsibility.  -Jeremy","The Quality Inn in Elizabethtown, KY is liable for the deaths of thousands of people if a fire occurs there.

"Never again quality suites. Just never again I have been a member for  years. My account is under my maiden name, Raven Johnson.  This past Saturday,  I stayed at the Quality Inn Suites in Cordova, TN on Varanas Rd. As arriving, front desk clerk Ricky Patel (Bobby Patel is the manager of this particular location) was in a full conversation with another guest that lasted  minutes without acknowledging that I was there. I know this because my alarm went off twice in  minute intervals. Ricky was severely rude and highly prejudiced against African Americans. I say that because in the previous conversation with the guest before me, I never heard him mention smoking and he told them the pool's operating hours. When it came to me, he mentioned ""no smoking"" once, and twice in front of my husband. I had my husband show up because my husband was paying and had to show his id. I have yet to understand why the specific reiterance of that phrase was needed, but I digress. He told us that the pool was closed and that family and friends were not allowed. (I'm a resident of AR, not TN. My mother's birthday was the only reason I came to Cordova and my loyalty to the company is why I stayed at that location). I received my room and upon arriving it was not ready. (Despite it being :12 p.m., check in time is usually :00p.m.) The housekeeper was cleaning the room, and sprayed not only a plethora of sprays but an insane amount. I had my infant daughter with me. I went downstairs to get another room. Upon explaining to Ricky the issue, he replied, "" oh well that doesn't bother me but oh well"". I was truly disgusted in his lack of concern about my room being ready. I asked him about the pool again because I noticed people walking towards the pool area. He then explained that the pool he tells local guests the pools are closed. I again explained that I am not a resident of TN and his response was ""well you know how that goes"". I have yet to receive clarity on that comment. When I walked down the hall to get to the second room, it smelled strongly of marijuana and tobacco. It was to the point of me having to spray a perfume from my bag. I inspected the room before having my family follow. As they are coming down the hall, they noticed the strong smell of smoke on that floor as well. The furniture in the room had to have been moved recently. Everything was so closed. I have pictures to show what I am explaining. My husband and I had to move the dresser around to have walking space. I continously bumped my shin on the edge of the bed because of the lack of space. There were several cords daisy chained (extension cords plugged to other extension cords) directly beside the bed. There was mold in the bathroom. I only stayed because the room was already paid for. The next morning, I went down the lobby to receive a ""breakfast bag"" as they called it. Greeted to a sign stating ""no eating in room, eat food in lobby"", I was left confused. I assumed it meant cereal or oatmeal option that was in the bag. Only thing in that bag was an oatmeal bar and a microwaveable chicken pita. After that, I knew choice hotels was off the list of upcoming stays. I'd rather pile up like sardines than to deal with another experience like that. Also listed was the ""apple juice"" that came out of the machine. I have never seen apple juice In that dark of color ever. In the second picture is mold I happened to see as I was using the bathroom Choice Hotels I have and awaiting your reply Also listed was the complimentary breakfast bag I would like that. It will become helpful in the near future. I have a birthday in August and an anniversary in September.  I greatly appreciate you not only taking the time to hear me out, but making sure the brand is saved. I'm two nights away from a gold status. Thank you so much.  I'm so thankful for you to hear me out","Raven Johnson stayed at the Quality Inn Suites in Cordova, TN on Varanas Rd.

"Can you guys just take the dang Starbucks codes back and give me half price in Amazon credit?? Never thought it would be this difficult to use rewards I'VE EARNED! It says the codes I got for the Starbucks are not valid. Ridiculous. I spend too much on comfort inn hotels to be going through this much hassle. Also, I don't believe I'm getting the right amount of points for all the rooms I book. Smelled weed in the hallways of the last couple places I've stayed. The more I'm with you guys, the more I'm starting to dislike. Spend literally thousands each month in choice hotels and it doesn't seem like the respect is there. CP ID: WXL82472

Name: William Larese

The dates I got the Starbucks codes that I can't use are as follows:   February st,  February th,  February th,  February th,  March th,  March th,  March th,  March nd,  March th,  March st,  April th,  April th,  April th,  May th. That's  extras I can't use. Also, while I have you, I'm positive I should have gotten more extras than that as well, as I've stayed so much during those months. I get extras now like twice a week and nothing has changed so for some reason they've been getting them right and giving me what I've earn recently but I went a long time not getting them. Can someone look into that for me? Or do you need more dates? Because I can provide. Please understand my frustrations and don't just blow me off please. I go through choice hotels for the rewards. Those Starbucks codes I for the life of me can't figure out. I'd at least appreciate getting those switched to the Amazon credit or something that would be of equal value, maybe some extra points so I can get a couple gift cards. I like those. Any help would be appreciated! Hello? Jeremiah, are you still there? Let me just say as far as the amazon when I get the ""extra""  email, I push the button that says ""use your extra"" it takes me straight to the Amazon website, where I am logged in I guess all the time, and let's me add the $2.50 to my balance just like that. But when I push that button from the extra email for starbucks it takes me to the comfort inn app. And I have a Starbucks app I am logged into. So I went to the Starbucks website and tried to find where I could just type in the code that's there and it said it's invalid. My email initially When I hit use the reward Then I go back and notice the ""use your reward"" is gone. There is the code right there I tried to use. I also try to use it going in the websites it shows at the bottom but they also take me to the choice privileges app I have tried and tried with this Starbucks credit. Honestly way too much for one lifetime. Just really wish I would have selected Amazon credit to begin with. If I only knew it was going to be like this. Thanks for getting back to me but I'm about done with it all. None work So I wrote out all those dates yesterday YOU REQUESTED and spent all this time for you guys to tell me you can't do anything about it? You can't get me my rewards I've earned? Nice. I know I've earned more EXTRAS than I have gotten. They've been flying in like crazy recently for some reason. Probably whatever issue there was is fixed. I used to not be able to get more than one ""extra"" a week. Now it's probably twice a week. Why is that? And when I get a room I get multiple rooms every time. Why don't I get double the rewards? I mean, that's how rewards are supposed to work right? When I spend money at your hotel you reward me for the business right? So when I spend double and get multiple rooms I don't understand why you guys don't reward for that? And if u stay at one hotel for more than one day I only get one extra? Is that how that works? So if I go down the street for the second night and back to the other one the next night, I get  extras? Just makes no sense. You'd figure you'd want someone to stay multiple days so you wouldn't have to clean the rooms and put up with more desk duty. But even with that, I just want what I've earned and there shouldn't be so much hassle. Right you are just repeating yourself how goofy your company is. Hurt someone for staying more than one night? Lmao. Ok. What a joke So you guys punish your customers for staying consecutive nights. I get it now, though. It just means I will go from hotel to hotel each night and you guys will have to clean each room and do desk duty with me every day. If you could just let someone know my concern I'd appreciate it. I get you may not be able to do anything but I'd like to at least get my feedback to someone important about this. Hello. Can anyone help me with the Starbucks rewards?? I have been asking for so long. Please help. I have $70 worth of Starbucks codes I can't redeem and you guys don't care. I am a diamond member and deserve better! I was getting  or  rooms a week but lately I haven't cuz you guys are showing how much you really appreciate me. Just want to be able to use my rewards. Starbucks codes don't work. Can someone please send me a giftcard for Starbucks or something? Maybe switch it with Amazon if that's a problem? Something.  ""extras"" I'm getting screwed out of. I've sent the dates to you guys MULTIPLE TIMES and NOTHING has been done. I'm loving some of these other hotels I've been staying at. You guys are going to lose a loyal customer over principle. I can't use the Starbucks codes. I've sent you guys pics of the app telling me the codes are invalid and have got nowhere. It's $70 worth of Starbucks and IM A COFFEE DRINKER What do you guys do erase previous messages? How insulting! Just want what I earned! $ in Starbucks I haven't been able to use in MONTHS! Just sitting there! Thank you! Hello, like always I'm going to be getting quite a few hotel rooms this week. Can I get a little extra incentive (maybe enough rewards points for an extra gift card or ) for using choice hotels? I'm going to spend a good bit of money on your business. A couple gift cards to Walmart so I can save on back to school shopping for my children would be nice. Thanks! No thanks Gretel. I'll go somewhere else I just think exceptional service includes giving fair rewards for spending my hard earned money on your hotels. If I spend $ on your hotels, a giftcard would be nice. You guys should make exception for people way passed diamond status. Hello I am wondering if you guys ever took care of that Starbucks extras problem I was having? U said it was taken up to your top people, your head honchos there, and you would get back to me in a couple weeks and haven't yet so please let me know what's going on. I can't use my $70 worth of ""Starbucks extras"" and it's irritating. I'm a diamond member and this is just wrong. Been dealing with it for far too long after all the business I give you guys! There is a Starbucks right now right in front of me that I can't go to cuz I CAN'T USE my ""rewards""! It's not right! Helder told me my situation was escalated on July st to the top people and it takes -10 business days for them to respond so ???? What is going on?? I haven't been able to use my Starbucks extras since I got them and now I'd just rather have half of it in Amazon which probably isn't possible but at least I'd possibly get it. Please someone let me know what is going on? Hello. I never received the  starbucks extras I never received the  Starbucks extras you are talking about. Also, I haven't received a $50 Walmart giftcard I redeemed on July th! Also, I got charged for an extra room on Monday. Only got  rooms and it says on the choice app I got  I don't think I got charged the extra room on Monday after all. The choice app said I did but my card statement said it was just the  rooms so I guess that's good. But if someone could look into those  Starbucks extra for me I'd appreciate it, and the $50 Walmart giftcard from July th I redeemed. Haven't received it! Would just be nice to have that soon for school supplies for my kids as they are about to go back. Thank u I looked in all my folders and I swear there is no Starbucks extras in there. Yea, nothing there. Just double checked. Hate to be a burden but just want to be able to get the rewards I earned.  You have the right email. You just haven't sent any emails with Starbucks extras. I never have a problem with my email. I didn get a  Amazon ""extra"" on Monday and Tuesday. Hopefully that didn't interfer with me getting the Starbucks I'm owed cuz I don't get Starbucks anymore it's Amazon credit. Might just have to send it again. I get choice hotels emails just spam usually. Checked it all tho I have already been waiting because of escalation. It's just over and over and iver I don't have time to be messaging you guys this much over rewards I should be getting, but am not! Ridiculous! I am a diamond member, spend thousands on your hotels and you treat me like dirt! This has already been ESCALATED. I waited the ENTIRE MONTH OF JULY due to ESCALATION. Then you guys tell me it's resolved and my extras are in my inbox AND THEY'RE NOT! I let you know that and it's back to ESCALATION??  What a joke! Get me my rewards please! And my giftcard from July th for a $50 Walmart giftcard still hasn't come in yet. What is up with that? Never had a problem, now all of a sudden it's issue after issue! Hello, I hate to keep bugging you guys but just wondering if you have heard back about my extras? It's been so long. Hello. It's been  weeks now and haven't received that $ Walmart giftcard from July th. Never had this problem before. Also haven't got the email with my Starbucks ""extras"". Really don't want the Starbucks anyway as I can never seem to get it to go into my app so what's the use? As a diamond member, I just deserve better than this. Tired of waiting on rewards I've EARNED. Any real help would be appreciated! It never came. You didn't send it out. I wait LIKE I ALWAYS WAIT. WHAT A JOKE! I will take my business elsewhere ed How disrespectful! Come on man... I am a diamond member and have spent thousands of dollars at your hotels just this year. Please don't shrug me off like that like I am a nobody. You guys don't reward your customers when you say you will. You told me you emailed me my new extras for Starbucks last week after over a month of escalation and this back n forth crap and it was a lie! I didn't receive ANYTHING in my emails (besides the receipts and constant ads of course!). So then what, after no extras you said were there?! More escalation! Haven't been able to use my reward since I signed up on the choice app. So sick of this. What about the customer? Now I am supposed to just eat a $ giftcard?? Wow! The disrespect is unbelievable! Now you just want me to go away. I came to you guys on here to get my rewards I EARNED! Nothing more!! It's the principle of it. I should get what's am supposed to get is all. Now because you guys never sent the $50 giftcard you can just say you aren't responsible for a lost card n it's all good right?? Nice customer service! I will definitely have to remember that when I am looking to spend $1200 on a few rooms for a few nights. I have now spent so much time on here messaging you people just to get what I am supposed to get it, that it's only fair for you guys to reward me with something extra for all of this craziness. I mean, all the minutes, no HOURS on here writing with you has cost me a lot of money! I definitely should receive something for that! And all the headaches and grief I've dealt with. This has ruined DAYS for me. I have gotten so much anxiety from this. I think it's only fair. Just want what I am supposed to get and what is fair and we can just stop all this back and forth. I love comfort inns and don't want to go to Wyndham's but just want some decent respect please!",Jeremiah Larese says he can't use the Starbucks rewards he's been getting.

"I've had some pretty bad hotel experiences in my life, but none so bad as I had this weekend with    ...that's just fascinating Hi there - yes, we're happy to share more details about our experience. I'll just have to check with some of the others, since we had five rooms. We checked in to the Quality Inn Aurora, CO on July th there were lots of minor issues, like rooms lacking refrigerators and other basic amenities, and the ""ice machine room"" was completely out of order, and then more challenging was that three of the five rooms had no air conditioning - we requested multiple times that someone come check on them, but that was never handled for any of the rooms and I would say the biggest problem was poor customer service. it was a huge hassle to check in, with one employee saying we couldn't until the person who booked the rooms arrived (even though his flight didn't get in until late Friday) and he had to make multiple phone calls for them to allow us to check in at all then, because the air conditioning situation was so bad, part of our group was going to leave and find a new hotel (which turned out not to be possible, as everything was booked up at other local hotels). but we confirmed with the front desk that, for our third night on our reservation, the one room we had for Sunday night would be one of the rooms with functional AC. the front desk confirmed that we could make that the room we kept for Sunday night. however, when we got back on Sunday evening, that room was locked and all of the stuff we had left in it had been locked up with housekeeping in a garbage bag. the front desk told us we could NOT keep that room, that we'd have to pay double the rate to get it back, and there was nothing they could do - except give us new keys to one of the rooms we had already checked out of, one which had no air conditioning. throughout the entire experience, the primary person we talked to (Christina) treated us like we were a huge inconvenience. I think we tried to be fairly understanding that broken AC isn't necessarily anyone's fault, and it's one thing for an employee to fail to express empathy for guests' issues, but she basically lied to us about which room we could keep and then pretended that we hadn't been very clear about what we had asked the night before No, it's because I've been hiking in areas without cell service - here's the information:  S Abilene St, Aurora, CO 
Names on reservation: Stephanski, Julian; Schindler, Joe; Guerin, Stephen. Brian Bedord and my name (Glenn Poole) were also added during check-in.

" is probably the worst hotel experience Ive ever had in my life. I unfortunately came down with COVID, called to see if I can cancel  hours in advance and was told to bad we have a no cancellation policy. Shame on this hotel. Never in my entire life have I ever been so disappointed in a hotel than this one. I came down with COVID provided my positive test, and Sleep inn & Suites in Rehoboth Delaware said to bad. They told me theyre not canceling and I either have to show up, or Ill lose out on my money. Ive provided a  hour notice. Ive provided a positive COVID test and your hotel still wants me to show up??? This is down right wrong.. Thank you Fernando for the response. I had send several emails and called the said hotel, and the manager rudely laughed and declined to cancel or refund me the money back. She stated I dont care and its my problem. They also charged the wrong card on file when processing the payment. The management staff at the hotel is unbelievable and I dont think I will ever understand why. This isnt a matter that is taken lightly, and to be belittled, laughed at, talked down to, hung up on, is totally unacceptable and dont understand how you treat your customers like this? If I didnt do the right thing and showed up at the hotel, I would have affected everyone. I even provided proof of my positive Covid test. And now Im punished because I wanted to not spread the virus further.",Sleep inn & Suites in Rehoboth Delaware said to bad they have no cancellation policy.

"Highly will not recommend anyone to buy points from Choice Hotels. Even though Choice Hotels promote points will not expire in  due to Covid, Choice Hotels took my ,000+ points away because my account is not active for  months. I purchased my points for what? Choice Hotels... you can call me chicken but I wish I could travel during pandemic.  PM'ed. Thanks Fernando! I have sent this. It looks like Choice Hotels have a different PM. Anyway, here is what I sent - Dear Sir or Madam, this is the information you are asking for. AXY48801,  Bueto Drive, East Lansing, MI , -336-5028, and my email is  To provide you more info. After I read the post, I called Customer Service, the representative is willing to give me % of my total points Maybe I am mistaken. But if Choice Hotels have suspended points expiration until Dec , . Doesn't that mean it will have additional  months that the account needs to be active? In addition, I live in Michigan. The state closure was in place until April . This is basically not feasible to travel until now. Does this mean the points do not expire in  mean nothing to me in this case? I was thinking since the points does not expire in , I will have additional  months to use my points This is why I do not understand. If my points are set to expire on /01/21. And now Choice Hotels points will not expire in Dec . This means this advertisement does not apply to me? This is why I feel like it is a false advertisement. Yes, they did refund my points, but only %. This means % of my points were forfeited even Choice Hotel promised no points expired in . This also indicates to me that Choice Hotel does not really look at the reality. As I said, I live in Michigan. Michigan does not lift the restrictions until April . So am I correct to assume that Choice Hotel penalizes me because of my state restriction? Fernando, thank you for your reply. During our conversation, you have never explained to me about whether -month inactivity applies after Choice Hotel's advertisement about points would not be expired in . Anyway, I am disappointed because I checked my points on June th as I was planning to use my points for th of July. When I checked, the website did not indicate that I must use my points before July , this is why I assume  months after Dec , . This is also why I decide to wait until I want to use my points on July  (and found out that it was all gone). If I knew that  months does not co-existed with point expiration in . I would have used my points on June th. (If you can, please check my searching record. You would have noticed that I am telling the truth). I appreciate that you all have applied one time cursory to give me % of points back. I am just so disappointed as Choice Hotel does no have a consistent policy; I just feel like Choice Hotel is taking advantages of small potatoes during the pandemic. Anyway, thank you for reaching out. I will stay firm on my comment about not buying points from Choice Hotels as the policy is not consistent with the advertisement, not to mention there is no notification from the account stating the time that points will expire. Update - Choice Hotel is willing to exercise one time cursory to give % (and then % after I questioned repeatedly) of my points back. During my -day messaging, I found out that even though Choice Hotel advertised points do not expire in , but if you have not stayed with them on June  , your points will expire on Jan ,  as the advertisement is only applied for the year . There is no further  month December . This means this advertisement does not help me at all, especially my state does not lift restriction until April . I just wish Customer Service does not dodge this question repeatedly (Maybe company policy does not allow it). There is no explanation or remainder on point expiration date, so buyer be aware as I have lost over ,000+ points. I just feel like Choice Hotel is taking advantage during the pandemic, especially the policy is not clear. Helder, you nail it. Choice Hotel policies do not fit my needs anymore. Once I use up all my points, I will not give my money to other Choice Hotels, especially I have my Gold and Plantium status with Marriott and Hilton. It will try to boost my status further with them instead. Thank you.  ",Fernando: I purchased my points for what? Choice Hotels... you can call me chicken but I wish I could travel during pandemic.

"Hello, my name is Kayla Byers and my fiance and I stayed at Mackinaw City Clarion and had an unpleasant experience. My fianc and I stopped for the evening in Mackinaw. We had scoped the hotel out online prior to booking due to the positive reviews. Unfortunately our experience was anything but positive. 

When we arrived at our hotel room , it reeked of cigarette smoke, had water damage in the bathroom, the wifi didn't work, and the jacuzzi seemed stained/unclean. Unhappy but with it being too late to find another hotel, we decided to make due and make the best of an unsatisfactory experience. After getting a few drinks and heading back to the hotel, our room key didn't work and we were locked out of the room. We walked up to the check in, got a new room key, walked back to our room, and it failed again still locking us out. Upset about our stay and now having our buzz killed, we got assistance from the front desk and had to change rooms to room  after checking the lock and determining it was indeed faulty

Once in the room, our wifi still didn't work so we had no access to the internet for the stay. In the morning the ""grab and go breakfast "" was a Granola bar, bottle of water, and an apple.

Thank you for refunding me the money for my purchase at Comfort Suites but the offer of ,000 points isnt a remedy. I have no intentions of staying at a choice hotel again so the points dont provide me any benefits. I can cash them out for a $25 gift card but the $25 doesnt put a dent in the amount of money I spent having to book a hotel at midnight because of your inability to remedy the solution. The corporate customer service told me to work with the front desk and hung up on me. The front desk couldnt do anything. And I was left out to figure it out on my own. I need to be reimbursed for my other hotel as well. I wouldnt have had to book one if my room was cleaned. Just because I havent responded in  hours doesnt mean its closed.

"we have used Choice Hotels for reservations over the past few years.  We have experienced a couple HORRIBLE experiences but no where to complain and it is always a hotel that gives NO REFUND once you pay.  In June we stayed in Hattiesburg, MS, the rooms not only smelled moldy - they WERE moldy.  You could see the mold along the floor/wall area in the whole room, the phone did not work, the ""free WIFI"" did not work, the employee was a whole new story, and we could not get our money back.  The Econo Lodge morning employee said she would do a particial refund while we were there checking out and we never received the refund and she was sending an email as well and it never came either.  The room cost was $88.80 and that is a lot of money to loose.  I did not expect a full refund because we did stay even though the room was really bad (it was late night).  I sent an email to the company as well and again NO response.  I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.

We never got past check in and he threw my credit card at me when I asked him to repeat what he said.  We continue to use Choice Hotel for help seeking a place to stay as we travel because we do not plan ahead not knowing where we will be ready to stop our trip for the day.

"Sevierville, TN - Quality Inn,  Winfield Dunn 

Reserved three rooms. Rooms were not set up as we were told. But the worst part was that the bedding was dirty, the toilet paper holder was hanging out of the wall, we had no A/C until the second day when they decided it needed to be replaced (after asking the third time), the light in the bathroom did not work, and the hanging rack was hanging out of the wall (we couldnt hang clothes on it). Hotel staff were NOT helpful at all.  We tried to make the best of it but it continued to get worse. 

As we decided to just let it go, our family proceeded to go to the outdoor pool. We didnt realize food and drinks werent allowed in the area. The desk clerk proceeded to tell one of our kids that we needed to get out of the area with drinks (very rude, didnt speak with an adult). 

After speaking with the manager, things escalated even further. She let me know that a maintenance person was not on staff today and it pretty much was an inconvenience. She also was not understanding at all when I said we didnt see the sign at the pool. We finished our drinks and food, started picking up our belongings and she proceeded to call the police to have us removed from the property. I had already offered to check out of our three rooms but that was a no go because theyd only refund one.  

In addition, the police were not helpful and generally very rude. They gave us less than thirty minutes to get off of the property which was absurd.  We had three rooms to pack up. 

In the meantime, another couple left due to their room being unacceptable and they couldnt get their money back either. 

Overall, it was a HORRID experience. We obviously inconvenienced them by being there and complaining that the room wasnt in acceptable condition.   

Im hoping to still get the refund on the one room at least. We luckily ran into someone that worked for corporate - hopefully she will be able to help us. 

Its very unfortunate - we own our own business that has a crew that travels ALL of the time (hence our CHOICE status being the highest level). We will no longer have our guys staying at any CHOICE hotels. We had  rooms staying in the Atlanta area, theyve checked out early and we wont be using any of their hotels until this is resolved. Hi Jendy, I received an email from Marion. She stated theyre investigating and will get back with me.

Guest name: Stephane Ferry .477.4240 OMG... the management reaponded to my review. Have a look. You folks should read the reviews on this property and the replies from the owner. They are damaging your brand severely These messages are from the owner, so forwarding to the owner wont really benefit anything. 

Thank you for the points though. My rewards is SXF22821 I have been a loyal Best Western guest for  years, Diamond Select rewards member, and I dropped them after consistent bad experiences with their flagged properties. 
We decided to give the Choice brand a shot, however after three bad experiences in four stays, we are having second thoughts. 
We checked in to a Sleep Inn and Suites in Union City TN tonight. First, no shower curtain in the room. Then noticed what looked like a blood stain on the floor between the beds. Then when we laid down in bed, my wife was disgusted to discover a blood stain on the pillow. 

I understand that mistakes happen, but how is it so consistent, with every property? That has already been done.. Please read above However no points have been posted to my account With what agreement are you asking me to respond question aunt? I said OK and thank you for the points. I will take the points but more importantly I think the issues I reported should be addressed Offering a guest points and doing nothing about the complaint is not a good resolution in my opinion As I said, I will take the points and appreciate them. I do hope that you take my complaints seriously and address the issues I have reported Acct # , arrival date /19/21 I am so angry.  The last two reservations that I have made, using rewards points were made with  points pLus $16. 

One in Union City TN, confirmation number  July -20. 
Card ending in  was charged $16. 
One in Hagerstown MD, confirmation number  July  Each time,  points was deducted from my account instead of , and my card was charged $16 each time as well So, I am due  points BACK for each of the two reservations. SXF22821

"Hi, I had a reservation at Sleep Inn in Post Falls Idaho for Saturday night (7/17). I booked it through your website. The hotel called me at :30 pm (!!!) on Friday night /16 to tell me they were overbooked and cancelled the reservation. They said it wasnt their error but the Choice Hotels websites error so they refused to take responsibility for helping us out. We were planning on leaving in less than  hours to head to this hotel. We were unable to find another place to stay in Post Falls and had to significantly alter our plans. The Sleep Inns customer service was absolutely atrocious. They said your website was at fault. We checked that evening and were still able to make online reservations at that hotel, so it seems there was a website error. Please make this right. Thank you. Thanks, Zaira. Below is a screenshot of my initial reservation followed by the email cancellation I received. I did not see the cancellation email at all before the hotel called and would have not seen it until I was on my way to the hotel. The hotel called me after  pm at night as well (the conversation where they said it wasnt their fault so they wouldnt help me). I travel frequently for work (Im a travel writer) and used to work in a hotel quite a few years ago, so I know the hotels customer service was appalling. I asked them to follow the professional standard of walking me to a different hotel, by finding a hotel with equal or better accommodations and paying for and arranging the reservation and they outright refused. The woman I spoke to suggested I find a hotel in a different state (Washington) and she mentioned a hotel she wouldnt recommend. Neither of which was helpful at all. This caused a significant disruption in our plans and we were not able to visit Post Falls at all (we even had dinner plans there). Please make this right. I have another Choice Hotel reservation for Thursday night this week in Missoula Montana) and would like to know you stand by your website and service. Thank you.   Thank you for the message, Zaira. The same hotel costs ,000 points to book for a Saturday summer night, so I think ,000 points would be appropriate. Could you please provide ,000 points (the equivalent of a comparable night at the same hotel that cancelled the reservation) to make this right? Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it.

There was a very suspicious white van with guys in it staring at her.I was over  hours away ad I live in another state and police were out with their spotlights and was very unsafe situation but the hotel refused to help me,promised I would not be charged, and told me she didn't know ""what to tell me as she didn't know how to help me or how to send a form"" for me to email back, she stated she didnt know what that even was?They let her sit in the car at night by herself with this criminal activity and refused to let her stay inside the hotel with me calling them and Choice Hotels.I called Choice Hotels,was on hold for  min each time, put on hold and then got hung up on each time for multiple times,never called me back and told me ""we will definately see that you get your money back and get this resolved as quickly as possible""they told me they could not reach the General Manager since I've been calling the night of(the th) and now at  am EST got in touch with said General Manager (was told prior that he is only in after  am during daytime hours) and he supposedly told Choice Hotels that it is their policy to charge me even if my daughter could not check in because she was a NO CALL NO SHOW.I've managed lots of hotels and that's not a NO CALL NO SHOW.My daughter could have gotten hurt or worse(I don't even like thinking about it, thank God the Good Lord was watching over her)!The hotel did not care, even with me prepaying-she was left to sleep in her car because all the other hotels were booked!I am trying to make this make sense.....
I was told by the hotel that booking straight through choice hotels is considered rd party...like, wait, what?Choice is the Corporation not a rd party.3rd party is Expedia, ,priceline, etc.....I'm so upset I was charged at all! Choice Hotels I've called a million times your Representative in your escalations/customer relations stated they couldn't help me get my money back and it was dependent on the ""General Manager"" and in which I've stated he said it was ""hotel policy"" to charge her as a No Call No Show--she was there and I was on the phone right away trying to get resolved but was told they couldnt help me/her. I know enough about hotels and how they work.I will message you all but I really do not expect much out of it.I'm so upset and am such a patient understanding person but this is unacceptable for a brand such as yours to allow your members to be treated so poorly, especially someone young female and all by herself at night in a bad/unsafe situation. No it has not be resolved at all. I still have charges and I am putting a dispute in with my cc company.This is insane. I was at work so I could not respond back yesterday.Here is my confirmation #33965840 the stay was SUPPOSED to be /17 to /21 I called the hotel and was told I would not be charged because the young lady did not know how to help me or would not assist in getting my daughter to a safe place, a lot of bad things could have happened to her!This is truly not okay how we were handled and how my daughter was treated. I begged her to help me get her in and was turned away no sorry no nothing just sorry I dont know how to help you. Thank you so much,havent been resolved yet. Allison Grooms dont fall for them looking into it doesnt matter how bad the situation,they tell you its up to the hotel and nothing is ever addressed.My daughter was in a terrible situation where she could have been harmed and was charged even though they turned her away and would not let her use her reservation by no fault of ours, by the hotels,1000%.I will never use choice again. Eddie Lorenz you are % correct Choice Hotels promoting bad hotels that are disgusting and dont even know how to help customers when trying to check in,especially young girls by themself,and it completely unacceptable to charge someone who is as trying to check in but the girl did not know how to do anything so she said we would not be charged.But in fact we did!My credit card company is on it,too bad you all were not.If my daughter would have been harmed,I would have done all I can to make sure ppl knew how terrible your hotels are! Choice Hotels is the worst!They just tell you the hotel is independently owned and operated and whatever the hotel says or does is what goes.Awful experience!Because of them my young daughter slept in her car at another hotel because the girl could not help her or I  she stated I dont know how to do that,I dont know how to maam you wont be charged though
Only to be charged bc of their mishaps!!My daughter was treated terrible and put out in the parking lot of one of their hotels with a creepy looking van full of men staring at her and cops searching for a criminal out in the lot & they told her she had to wait in her car!!Like how can choice promote hotels but yet not help when there is an issue?!?Im at a real loss.my family isnt using choice ever again.

Penny Gail the only way to get anything done is dispute through your bank,that is why Im grateful I used my cc and not my debit. Choice Hotels why?you all will just say its up to the hoteland the hotel will deny it. Andi Calhoun theres a reason they wont allow pics and videos,then the cat is out of the bag.Im appalled at their hotels! ***DONT BOOK WITH Choice Hotels! Dont let them lie to you,Ive managed hotels and corporate does have a say!!!I have never heard of such ridiculous mistruths than from the corporate office of these hotels. I do not buy that one little bit,Ive managed hotels and I know corporate has a lot of pull and say with these situations!Ive tried calling the General Manager and the hotel does not even answer,rings and rings then disconnects the line no matter the time you call.My family will never use your hotels again neither will anyone I know.Ill stick with Raddison.They know how to treat their customers.I have always said it is easier to keep a customer than to make one.It wasnt even about the $68 .It was the point,my daughter could have been kidnapped,hurt, killed or raped and nothing was auctioned on!This is sad.Its okay Ive taken it up with my credit card company and its not over.I will do whatever it takes to make sure this is how customers of yours are treated, so they do not fall victim to this scam and poor treatment. Actioned** Amy Myers there is no manager that looks into anything, Im sure.I feel they just tell their customers that to get them off their back,I have tried calling the hotel over and over to no avail,rings until it disconnects.So I wonder how choice gets a hold of the GENERAL MANAGER?

We attempted to settle into the room when more live roaches began to crawl on the walls. I went to the front desk to inform them of the pest problem. The lady apologized and said it was because of the rain. A guy from the hotel was sent to put down some boric acid. He put it behind the refrigerator and said that should take care of the problem. 

We left to get dinner. Once we arrived back we noticed several live roaches in the restroom and some that had been smashed against the wall either by the previous guests or the cleaning crew. The live roaches had taken over the room. They were crawling ON THE BEDS, walls, ceiling, countertops and floor. On top of all of that there were BED BUGS! 

We unfortunately could not check out the same night because the front desk was closed. The customer service number I called regarding my refund said everything had to be handled at the front desk. The option doesnt allow you to speak with a person it automatically disconnects the call after stating the front desk at the hotel needs to be contacted. We (WITHOUT ANY SLEEP DUE TO ROACH AND BED BUG ATTACKS) waited until the following morning to go to the front desk to checkout and get refunded. 

I was given a refund for the days I did not stay but not for the initial night of the th. According to the hotel I did not checkout the same night so they are refusing my refund. I could NOT checkout the same night because they were closed and the customer service number said refunds are handled at the hotels front desk. My total was $516.08. I was given a refund of $435.78. They have refused to give the remaining balance of $80.30 which is all I am requesting.

Your App was an epic failure and could not book anything in the same county- even though to target hotel and  closest hotels all confirmed dozens of rooms were in fact available.  If you look at the way it was finally booked, instead of the  weeks we wanted, we had  reservations for  week, each  per night, and then a paid day, and then another  reservations, again  night a time - then an impossible to book night then another  days of one night a time reservations! That is ridiculous! That impossible to book night was instantly booked by the front desk.
Hotel staff can not book with reward points. You have the only hotel chain on the planet where that is true.
Marriott where we only had ,000 points book us a room night in one call to the hotel, is mess than  seconds. Contrast that to the HOURS spent getting this done with Choice where I had ,000 points.
You should be way nicer to your top clients!!! My name is Adam but the account is under Gigi Grill member Diamond Elite account GXG61614 Want to be very clear, I gave you  chances to make this happen. It sort of worked  of those  times, but constant disconnects made it impossible.  points is nice but does NOT make up for how bad you system works. Get me connected with someone who care enough to improve that process and Im sure they will also want to make this RIGHT for one of your very BEST customers Ive consumed + travels days at the less the lovely Comfort Inn in Medford NY. This isnt for fun, nor business. It is force by circumstance after a house fire. The staff at the hotel are excellent, but they are limited by your system. You are NOT the highest level of customer service. The is certainly your Boss, and they have a Boss, and somewhere above them is the Director of Customer Experience who has a name with the title and a direct dial phone number. That is the person who I should be talking to. If you want me excepting points that are this difficult to use, dont insult me with tiny amounts of those points.  Use numbers that inspire belief in your understanding just how spectacularly youve abused what it certainly This hotels best Client. Here is a hint: I spend miles in ,000 chunks. Start there and work your way up. Jendy, if this is being escalated, when will I hear back from someone in power who can effect positive change?
This was a MAJOR SCREWUP, not a little inconvenience. Your offers are tiny drops in an ocean of change that must happen. Make it a much more rewarding offer There have been  different respondents to this thread. Hoping you all read all that was written. We were first offered ,000 points, which only materialized as ,000 and youve gone on to offer LESS each time, like this is a joke to you.
Let me remind you that ALL of our problems are with using your Choice Rewards Points. If you are going to give us more of those incredibly difficult to use points, at least do it in amounts worthy of an attempt. Rooms start at ,000 points. We only book at least   nights at a time. A good start at making this right would be multiples of that amount. That would start at ,000 points. Frankly, we would much prefer the CASH equivalent. Add all the points you want to the account. Note that this issue will not be successfully resolved until your system is FIXED. They are not acceptable. None of this is acceptable!","Gigi Grill is a Diamond Elite member with almost Million Reward points.

"Good morning,

I had a room booked at the Comfort Inn Boardwalk in Ocean City, MD but had to cancel. It was booked through but they told me to reach out to you directly as everything was already processed on their end. For one, i wasnt supposed to be charged until check in but the money was taken as soon as I booked, and two, its been almost  days and I still have not gotten my money back. I even messaged the hotel directly, and the response I got was a screen shot of something that I had no clue what I was looking at. Ive read a lot of reviews that choice hotels is very rigid with their cancellation policy but, I canceled within the timeframe, by Wednesday July st at , and I actually canceled on Tuesday. So not sure what the hold up is. Its over $500 and I need that money back. If Im not refunded my money very soon I will be getting a lawyer. The booking was under Shelby Lynch and confirmation number . Thanks. Ok thanks so much.","I had a room booked at the Comfort Inn Boardwalk in Ocean City, MD but had to cancel.

The office clerk on the afternoon of /6 was extremely rude and obnoxious; not what you expect when booking a room for the night.  The beds were ROCK HARD and not comfortable at all.   The laminate flooring was SLIPPERY.  I called yesterday to obtain my confirmation number, which I misplaced.  The clerk said she was going to send it via email; but she NEVER DID.  To me, that is another negative for this hotel.  I then called at  a.m. and spoke to a gentleman with an ""Indian"" or ""Middle Eastern"" accent, and he was also very rude.

I feel so violated. My youngest son has been crying all day. One bike, mine, was a present from my parents who died in a car crash  years ago on July . I just expect more I guess. Im so upset and sad right now. (And to be fair. Choice hotels brand) A free night? We just lost: $3,000 of bikes. $200 of bike rack repairs. A wasted day of precious vacation days and a ton of upset and stress. Not to mention my poor you g childrens experience through this ordeal. A few night is a joke and I hope you can understand that. All of this could have been averted by the hotel staff taking their job seriously.

 please remove Comfort Inn and Suites Lombard from your group benefits list.  They allow employees to threaten guests with bodily harm and allow strange men access to underage girls rms. See my review  My party made group reservations for  July rd through the th.  We were not given a confirmation number.   rooms were under Gabriel Jackson, the other  rooms were under LaChanee Hipps.  All rooms used her card to pay.  The group stayed there under Buck Out Cleveland . The name of LaChanees dance studio, the reason we were in Chicago performing this weekend.  The majority of the girls were between  and .  I made our reservations with Violet, the sales representative for Comfort Inn and Suites in Lombard, IL.  Upon arrival  girls went to their room, used the room key, opened the door and saw a man sitting on the bed playing guitar.  Thankfully he was in there when they arrived, versus coming in later with his key when they were getting dressed or sleeping.  Another room had stinky food .  We still stayed in the room for one night because when we requested house keeping they said its too late.  So we decided to wait instead of moving.  By the next day the room was unbearable, however the room had clean beds , not sure why how the food was still left.  By this time housekeeping came, opened the door and it still stunk very bad as they were cleaning.  At that point our girls had to be moved to another room.  Next unpleasant situation, all within one weekend, the elevator started jolting and dropping before getting us to the correct floor, it felt like a roller coaster.  Saturday at :30am I experienced that, then later hotel staff mentioned the hotel was aware of it having problems since Friday the rd at  noon.  There was no sign and no mention of the elevator experiencing safety issues at our check in Friday at :30pm.  After my experience I told staff.  Saturday :30am  more party members arrived, used the elevator.  Was not informed about the issue until the elevator door was closing.  Michelle the staff member told them you may experience a problem but it would still get you to the right place to them after theyve already pressed the nd floor button.  It did not get them to the nd floor at all.  They were stuck for several minutes.  With one having a medical history of panic attacks, this triggered her mental anxiety.  Maintenance had to help them, Michelle was not at the front desk to hear the help bell.  Thankfully their cell phones worked in the elevator to alert a member of our party that was in the hotel still.  Most members were gone for performance practice.  After getting stuck in the elevator she was upset and asked for a credit to the staff.  Instead of the Michelle stating she was not the correct person, she argued with our group member.  Michelles daughter and granddaughter were in the lobby, after the incident Michelles daughter threatened bodily harm to party member stating Shes lucky shes here if she was anywhere else we would beat her ass!  After that statement Michelles daughter went to our party member and demanded the affected customer give her mother an apology.  We are requesting a full investigation of the tapes during that whole day.  After the incident I requested to speak with the general manager Frank.  Michelle refused to allow me to speak with the general manager several times before I raised my voice to continue to request speaking with Frank. At  noon she said Frank was sleeping, then she said she couldnt call him, then she refused.  We asked for a business card she said he doesnt have one.  Later at pm we spoke with Frank.  He was at the hotel for his shift.  After apologizing he took a defense position.  Even mentioned to the affected party member that she should have used the phone in the elevator, as if it was her failure of not knowing how to be properly stuck in an elevator as the reason why she was stuck so long.  He told us the best he could do was give $60 as a credit.  Our party paid over $2500.  He mentioned we already received discounted nights.  Yes we did, assuming that the elevator worked and that we would not be threatened in Chicago a city known for murders with bodily harm.  Due to that situation we request a full refund for our stay.  Even Monday after we home I called Violet, she told me to call the hotel and ask Frank to do something more for us.  Frank said no he couldnt, and each time he came from a disposition as if that situation was no big deal.  Im not sure if it is because our party is all Black as well as the employee that threatened us.  Maybe he feels that our lives dont matter, if our bones were shattered from a  foot drop in the elevator.  Maybe Frank who is Caucasian doesnt believe our lives were truly threatened by that employee.  Im not sure but his stance and tone was completely inappropriate. I mentioned to him was that all he could do because this is a legal issue, which it is, were not being informed about the elevator experiencing problems beforehand.  If we were we all couldve made the informed decision not to use before becoming affected by the situation.  He got extremely defensive and said its not, I got lawyers, you got lawyers.  As of to blow me off,    most of the party were young dancers and would and could be extremely affected by a  foot drop as well as psychiatric trauma.  Thankfully, it did not happen to them alone.  I would like Michelle and Frank to be let go for the situation, and for us to receive a full refund for our entire stay, we will think twice about staying with Choice Hotels in the future without an acceptable resolution.  Thank you for reading and allowing me to voice my concerns Before accepting I would like to know for one room, one night, approximately how many points does that use?  

When do the points expire? 

Can they be used for group rates or any other discounts? So one night, one room will mostly use all points.   rooms, over  people in our party were affected. 

No thank you.  Please offer provide another offer.  rooms were under my name.  The foul smelling room was under my name. Was there a resolution for the hotel staff Michelle and her daughter?  Our party was threatened in Chicago, a city known across the globe for murders.  Our license plates are visible and provided to hotel staff for parking.  License plates are public record, and Chicago has been known for soliciting physical harm to people even after they have left Chicago and are back in their cities. 

Have the tapes for that day been reviewed?  
 ,000 points equals barely  nights, For a lower grade hotel. with the same type of employees with low grade customer service skills and the same set of problems.  

Please provide another offer. Is this a threat that this is my last offer?  Again, we were threatened with bodily harm, a strange man had access to teenage girls hotel room after check in.  And old food stunk the room up so bad that house keeping could not fix the smell.  
 ,000 points, maybe  nights at your lower grade hotels?  Thats the best offer in order to regain our trust in Choice Hotels? I see. Phone is .299.3492 email is   No member ID.  May I transfer these points to anyone I choose?  viola ave, Cleveland, OH

Manager was rude.
Credit card machine was ""broken"" we had to pay cash.
My shoes were sticking to the carpet.
The first room was the nastiest hotel room  I have ever seen.  I have pictures.  The second room was only slightly better, if we would have gotten our money back we certainly would have left.
Most rooms had the top door lock swung over so the room doors were left open. People coming and going out of those rooms and in and out of the windows. No towels in the rooms, no telephone, no mini-fridge in the first room. The furniture was all broken down, the light in the bathroom was broken so they put a lamp in there. The bed frame was broken in the second room, the air condition didn't work well, the sink stopped up and no hot water in the shower. The front desk would not answer the phone so I had to walk all the way across the hotel to get towels,  phone, etc. There isn't any maid service. The police were there the whole weekend with things going on. I feel like this place is just laundering money. I will be making a post with pics of this place. The manager ruined our weekend by her behavior,  I bet she has never even stepped into one of the rooms she is making people stay in.

"Want to make it right? We had a reservation for the Clarion in Merrillville, Indiana. Checked at at approximately pm. At that time, they said our room was not clean yet, but that they were working on it. Came back at  pm, opened the door, and it was as the previous guests had left it. There were no other rooms available. This in absolutely unconscionable. We are planning on traveling the Midwest weekly in the next few years and currently I don't think I can get my family to stay at any Choice hotel. Thomas Fuller, /30/21, Confirmation Number:  We left at approximately pm last night. I called the hotel and we were never checked out after leaving at pm. This is obviously another strike on our stay. We should now be checked out, finally It is acceptable, however, we don't believe he has an account.

"Arrived at my destination Quality Inn, Springboro OH around pm /31 only to be told there was no room ready for me due to lack of housekeeping staff, and that my room would not be ready until possibly pm.  I asked about some sort of concession on the room rate due to loss of use but he said I had to talk to the manager (that was not there).  I had reserved this room about a week prior as a platinum member.  Desk clerk had no name badge and was wearing a white undershirt.  I finally called the # and talked to someone there and they proceeded to locate another Quality Inn in the area.  After being put on hold for about  minutes, the line disconnected.  I had to call again and explain the situation all over again but finally got another room reserved.  It was a frustrating evening after being on the road for  hours.   Arthur Rein I have some horror stories as well.  To be fair they are not just Choice properties.  The best though is when I checked in and entered my room about pm and there were guests sleeping in there!  (Clerk assigned me the wrong room!)

"Bobby Joe do not rent from Choice hotels and Choice you can't keep having me reach out to you in private and not refund to be each and every dollar overcharged higher that my diamond tier rate in the  some nights at  different franchise operators that  percent of them failed to return incedental deposits I was charged a rack rate at almost every stay over night in my history Choice Hotels what about looking in to membership #BLD5805 note that most all stay overs were overcharged higher than my member or booked rate and often incedentals were not returned this has been happening since day one of membership yet not one franchise operator will refund the price difference on each night booked or stayed over  Choice .. Grettel it's much work on my part when my membership number will pull up every stay as a diamond member I feel discounted and unvalued when choice has these records all I'm asking is that Choice. Corp send an email to each franchise operator that I stayed asking them to view each night stayed the rates and refund the price difference and award what ever they think is fare for hardship refunding those funds to the card they have on file to prevent price gouging reprocussions and the loss of me as a member at this time no harm done in  days that shall change It has not been resolved my friend. What we are dealing with is I am living a modern day date line special just waiting to pop. I was a confidential informant and buying agent for  years to a near dozen police departments across the country. I am the cause of hurting the businesses of some major crime rings in this country but most of the world knows not this aspect of my story. They only know what they see on TV and newspapers. If you were to take the time to Google my name  and read every story about me you will discover I love to help people. My efforts are tethered to Christianity and what I have against me is the spirits and principalities mentioned in the book of proverbs  this spirit packed principality is more the enemy to the masses than mine but they remain comfortable unaware. This principality has corrupted minds lives and souls even with in your company. Mainly your franchise operators. I would always notice in my accounts that things or balances would never add up. Being distracted by threats to my way of life and life I never had time to look into the money. I just now got the attention of law enforcement to investigate my case. What I am experiencing is called retaliation witch is a felony. However this retaliation is done through social engineering and proxy process. When you Google my name read all stories about me after reading about my dad's murder scroll down and read all news programs about me. My Dad was murdered by a proxy and my finances were attacked as well as all aspects of my life. I begged for Choice to help before it got to this level. It's still not to late to prevent Choice franchise operators from being charged with a crime called facilitation and fraud all I'm asking is they say they are sorry and to refund the price difference between what was charged and the correct amount that should have been charged at nearly every stay since being a member and to get my deposits returned as well as the some  percent that charged me twice. If not done by the efforts of choice it will be done with bad publicity and civil action with criminal action. I believe in choice I chose to put food on each of your tables for your family to enjoy by choosing to stay with you. I don't believe you condone this but action will be the only thing to validate this I will watch my card balance climb as you investigate each and every stay and charge . James chapter . Verse   Member number BLD5805 If you choose to send a letter to each and every franchise operation in witch I stayed and my last message I sent here along with the data of all my stays and charges asking them to ablidge to my request it will protect choice and each franchise operation witch is what I seek to do because I understand now more than I did yesterday on the matters at hand that are much larger than our relationship I am still dealing with the same spirits and principality now & so is the church body and anyone who has crossed my path. My enemy is more the enemy of the masses then my enemy. This spirit packed principality has comfortably convinced the Church body to do God's word backwards. God's word said to watch for these spirits that would form principalities. He made it super clear in a number of verses. One that comes to mind is in Proverbs when he stated "" "" We wrestle NOT with flesh (as in they brother) but rather spirits & principalities"""" When one chooses to use their free will to serve the desires of these spirits & spirit led principalities they blindly become servants of the wrong God. The spirit infection keeps them hostage to it's desires so comfortably. Just a few pages over in Proverbs it states one is called to expose such principalities led my spirits not of God. I told Abu Arcadia of Des Moines Iowa & only one or two others years ago before my story broke that an organized crime ring was sure to come for me. I came to Iowa in hopes to be free from them and to get closer to God. I was still struggling with a number of thorns in my side besides them. Because of the people I was choosing to surround myself with more and more to cure some thorns and the publicity I was getting made it difficult for this group of people to carry on their normal way of life for me along with it's original goal. In order for it to get back to it's state of comfort and path of it's goal it needed to shred every relationship. It was with threats of killing my Dad ( who was later killed by a proxy who knows not he was a proxy) to threats of killing my adopted son Daniel Marshall Cuttill ( Who since has reached out to me telling me ( Dad I need you. I am going through things like you but in a different way please help then connection and his words disappear) It is through control social control electronic control threats that gave the director editor narrator and producer the power over many people for it's social engendereing to steer from their faith and me their brother. I been living a life I do not want to live manufacturered from a sliver of a true old life. This principalities motives are retaliation and revenge towards me some  years later when I was a documented paid informant and buying agent with a number of police department across the country for a near  years . I worked with MEGSI  a police agency at  then on to Broward county sheriff's office then Phoenix police department then Kansas City police department many others too. I want it to be very clear that it's my work with Chicagos police department that has caused all this. My work with officer Jason Clark and his partner Tim. Once my work was identified by this principality oddly rookie officer at the time ( my partner,) Jason was promoted ( wink wink ) to City wide the wink wink promoted is from he being limited to burglary . My story has not changed and my pleas remain the same I want to be free from this principalitiy in order to do so I first must free the church so they can love me again and see me through seminary. I have pleaded with the church's enemy that it must save itself and all of it's members they must repent and make amends to save their souls but they hear me not. My only hope is someone who likes mystery and truth or puzzles that wears the full armor of God Messages chech your messages see the Bobby Dep YouTube channel then Google Depper reminds Christian's then note my dad's murder on Google do know that your franchise operators were facilitating criminal activity for a smart organized crime ring I'm willing to excuse choice hotels Corp and each franchise operator that chooses to use their free will to refund unto me and card on file all funds district court  in Texas the real FBI not the impersonators are investigating my case under the court order of a state judge let's pray the people behind all this take me up on my offer that they repent and make amends and disappear for full forgiveness and mercy Hello Please respond to your messages in thought word and deed  I'm still waiting for you to reach out to each franchise operator on your diamond members behalf and in writing asking them to view each charge and deposits and ask them to refund the price difference between each rate charged for all nights including stay overs with my earned member rate to card on file",Bobby Joe is a confidential informant and buying agent for years to a near dozen police departments across the country.

"Ive tried calling the customer complaint hotline many times with hours long hold times and no answer. My hotel stay had blood in the room and no AC. I demand a refund and an explanation. The hotel was a Quality Inn and Suites at  Parkway, Pigeon Forge TN, 

My experience : We arrived at this location for a birthday get away. Checking in, the staff was very rude and quick, acting as if it was a hassle I was there to begin with. When we received our room, we went to it to discover that the A/C barely worked, causing it to never get below  degrees in the room, while it was  degrees outside. The maintenance crew came multiple times to only remove the cover and replace it and say they fixed it. The fireplace was stuck on too, causing heat to enter. The bed had spots of blood on it, or red wine, unsure. Management was contacted and they refused a refund and refused to move us to another room. Walking barefoot on the floor of the room caused our feet to turn coal black. The shower had no water pressure, the internet only worked % of the time. The parking is terrible as well. Unless you get back in super early, you have to park all the way across the road at a whole other building. All in all, this was a terrible place, and I wouldnt let my dog sleep there. 

The date of arrival was /30/2021

Name : Zachary Foster 

We wanted to check out early due to this problem, but couldnt due to no vacancies in the area. Why can I not just receive a refund? Why is it so difficult to compensate your customers who have to experience this? Would you have paid $250 a night for that? Ridiculous. Id like to sign up for the ,000 points.

"I suspect that my gift card sent for redeeming rewards point has been stolen from the mail and customer service claims they will NOT cancel and replace the card. How can this be? I'm calling to cancel (hopefully) and replace before it is used. Please help! Sure - my name is Martin Gantz member # is mxg74563, address is PO Box , NY NY , email is  and phone # is -434-6666. I know that the $50 gift card was to be delivered on Monday /2/21 since I have Informed Delivery from USPS and I have an email picture of the envelope to be delivered to my PO Box on that day. However the letter never arrived and I strongly suspect foul play at the post office. I've never had a mail piece more than  day late let alone an entire week. And since the envelope was easily identifiable as a gift card I  anted to let you guys know asap in order to cancel and replace.  This was the photo of the gift card letter that should have arrived on Monday. I understand the usual timing for the mail delivery, however in this case there is evidence of the card not being delivered to my mail box on Monday /2. The card was not delivered. Waiting is unlikely to do anything other than assure a thief will try and use it. That is why I am asking you to cancel and replace the card now instead of waiting further. I understand that Choice is not responsible for a lost or stolen card. And I am asking for an exception due to the good faith effort I've shown. That's why I'm asking for Choice to cancel the card now since there is evidence for the card being stolen, and replace the card given the good faith effort made by me. The basis of my request to you is to cancel and replace the card given the prompt facts I have shown and the good faith effort made by me. OK - I was hoping you'd be able to cancel the card now, but I'll wait the  weeks and will let you know if it comes in the mail. If I haven't received the card by then I certainly appreciate your offer to provide a different experience of sending the card - hopefully I will receive the original card and you won't need to send the replacement.

"On May ,  I was visited by the police and was told by the police that I had to pack up and leave because the management wanted me to evict me because someone had told management that I had been taking pictures of children. This is unconscionable and should not have happened as it is not illegal for anyone to take pictures or video of anything that is within public view. I want and expect an apology from your hotel chain regarding this issue. Management should have known better than that and should have dealt with this person's complaint better. The police never should have been called as I did not do anything illegal or wrong. I went to Florida to meet a woman in person that I had been talking to online, but could not verify if she was real or not. I stayed at your motel in Kissimee as it was the closet motel that I could find to where this woman was staying and was the only motel that I could find at the time that actually had rooms available. Photography is a passing hobby of mine and I like taking pictures of things that I see not only for posterity, but also to improve my photography skills. The pictures and video's that I was taking were of the property and the surrounding area and were with the intent of being able to preserve the memory of my trip to Florida. I am not happy about what happened to me and I believe that an apology by your hotel chain is in order as photography is not a crime and I should not have been treated like a criminal for taking pictures and video of the area. Kissimee is a well known tourist hotspot because of Disney World and Epcot Center and Seaworld. Photography and tourism go hand and hand and is to be expected in an area like Kissimee. The management should have known that as it is important to your business and overall bottom line. If your hotel chain tries to prevent people from taking pictures or video's during their stay at your hotel, then you can and will lose customers and business and that can and will effect your ability to stay in business. This matter should have been handled much better by the hotel management and an apology to me is in order. This kind of behavior is bad for business and it can lead to potential lawsuits as people have the legal right to photograph or film anything that is within public view. This issue needs to be properly addressed before it becomes a legal issue. I do not have a confirmation number. The name of the hotel was the Clarion Inn & Suites - Maingate located at  Irlo Bronson Hwy in Kissimmee, Florida. This incident occurred on May , . I checked in on Tuesday May ,  and checked out on Sunday May , . I found this hotel through a Google search on my phone on Tuesday May , . I chose this hotel as it was close to where I was at the time and because of their nightly rate and their availability of rooms at the time. With the exception of this incident I did not have any issues with the hotel and actually liked the hotel itself. If this issue can be positively resolved, then I will recommend this hotel to others, but only if this issue is resolved. I will not recommend any hotel or motel that tries to penalize or criminalize guests for things like taking pictures and videos. Basic common sense says that you do not attack or try to criminalize tourists for taking pictures as it is an unwritten rule that when you are on vacation you take pictures and it is something that most hotels/motels know and understand. No one likes being treated like a criminal for taking pictures and any business that attempts to penalize or criminalize tourists/vacationer's for taking pictures and video's can and will lose business and find themselves out of business as that can and will get around through word of mouth. Basic common sense says that you want your guests to positively remember their stay with you so that they will potentially recommend you and your business to their friends, family and business associates. That is why customer service is so important. Without guests, your business is out of business.

"On /27 I attempted to book a room on the app. When I hit the final button to book an error appeared on the screen I tried to the process again and another error. I ended up staying at the holiday inn across the street from this motel.   days later I noticed a charge on my credit card for the room.  I called customer service and after several failed transfers and  hours of my life. I was told I would receive a call from the supervisor within  hrs. That was  days ago and still nothing. Ive emailed several times only to get told on one I actually stayed at the motel amongst other things. This year alone Ive stayed  + days at choice properties. During original call the representative couldnt  find reservation and until points were awarded it didnt show on my app. 
I was charged .00 for an app error and cant believe Im still fighting to get reimbursed. I guess I will just have to post this on as many sites as I can find so no one else goes through this Michael Vann
This is the receipt that was collected as I said on your Facebook account I got an error message when making the reservation. I have stayed at this motel for the last years or more. I just want this straightened out please. I would be happy with that. I agree the hotel was not at fault for this it was the app that failed not them.  points will just about make me whole. I stay at choice hotels consistently and am very glad this could be worked out.

"  Congratulations- you gave me the worst experience I have had at a hotel in my  years of traveling.  I will never recommend Quality Inns again. Per your response to my tweet regarding my recent stay. My name is Susan Fultz.   On  July , my daughter and I were traveling from Kentucky to New Jersey to visit my son for my birthday /30 and to celebrate the end of my radiation treatment.  I recently completed two months of radiation treatment for cancer, and we decided to stop at a hotel, and finish our drive on Saturday.  We couldn't find a hotel at several exits, and went in through the Choice app about am on /31.  We were connected with a very nice reservation specialist, Kenn Laurence.  He found a hotel with rooms, and gave us a choice of a King room or a room with two double beds at the Quality Inn and Conference Center,  Ramada Road, Somerset, PA .  We prepaid the room - he said that it was non-refundable.  The Acct #was .  When we arrived at the hotel, totally exhausted at :30am, the desk clerk was very rude, said there were no rooms (""the manager told me that we were sold out when he went to bed at midnight"").  I said we had  a reservation, and she said she didn't care - there were no rooms.  I showed her the prepayment on my charge card and my reservation in the Choice app.  She watched my daughter unload bags onto a luggage cart, and then said, oh - here is a room.  She kept saying she was new and didn't really know what to do - the hotel was sold out.  She gave me a key card and said she didn't know how to tell us how to get to the stairs - that she didn't know her way around the hotel - I asked about an elevator, and she said there was not an elevator - in a conference center? and after watching my daughter load a luggage cart.  She walked us to the end of a hallway and left, and my daughter hefted our bags up the stairs.  We go to the end of another hallway, open the door to the room and it is a totally uncleaned room.  Beds used, bathroom filthy, food on the tv stand.  Went to call down to the desk - phone unplugged.  Crawled on floor to find the phone cord, called desk, she said to bring everything back down to the lobby - she was ""talking"" with the manager.   We moved everything back down two long halls - I was close to collapsing at that point.  Got back to the lobby - she told us to wait - the manager was ""putting on his pants"" and would be ""down"" in a few minutes.  She kept mumbling about she would clean the room if she had to, that it would all be her fault, that she is new, that she would make sure the manager put us on the first floor, etc.   We waited a bit, manager was a no show, then she said - just a minute - let me check this other King room (3 doors down from the lobby).  She came back a minute later and said she could put us in that room (in a hotel that she said had rudely told us no rooms were available upon arrival).  By this time, it was after am - the manager never showed up.  We went to this room - luckily it was clean.  We stayed in that room - it was very hot upon arrival - we turned the air down and went to bed.  When we woke in  the morning - the room was still uncomfortably warm.  We went to leave at a little after am.  No receipt had been put under our door.  Got to the lobby - nobody behind the desk - just a placard saying assisting another guest currently.  Nobody came, we put the keycard in the basket and left.  I have been traveling for business for over  years, and have never been treated like that.  Apparently, the manager told her I was lying about prepayment - the desk clerk never ran my credit card, but I had a pending charge on my credit card - which the reservations specialist had taken over the phone.   Hefting bags around a hotel to a dirty room, hefting them back down, in warm hallways, was not an experience I would expect.  I felt disrespected and was being called a liar.  This hotel was subpar and the experience was extremely disappointing.  I filled out the hotel survey sent by email reflecting the above information, and this morning I got an email saying, ""Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel."" and that was all.  Not what I expect from Choice Hotels. I do appreciate the offer and I accept.  My member ID is SGF3101, my phone number is -760-3101, email:  and address is:   Presidential Drive, Hebron, KY  .   Susan Fultz.   I do want to clarify my review put on the website - I did not demand to see the manager at am.  The clerk told me the manager was coming down.  (the hotel response makes it sound like I was being unreasonable and demanding to see the manager - which I never asked for-, when all I wanted was a room I had paid for and sleep).  He also calls your app a ""third party"" app and not the brands app.  Thank you. ","Susan Fultz's daughter and I were traveling from Kentucky to New Jersey to visit my son for his birthday /30.

"To whom it may concern;

We have made  attempts at reaching the Quality Inn & Suites Manager in Owego New York regarding the charges and the unsanitary conditions of both our rooms booked for one night only. We did receive a call back from Jessica, the night shift clerk who stated the Manager was willing to offer a % to % discount on both rooms.  This is NOT acceptable.   We should be receiving a full refund based on the disgusting, uncleanliness of our rooms. Not to mention, management told us not to check out and stated we would receive a call from him! He did not call and we were charged for the room anyway!

I sent photos, proof of what we encountered, with the Choice Hotel logo displayed on one of the photos. This Manager has still not called us back. 

Once again, this is simply not acceptable. I will be contacting the State health department, and provide the photos. In addition, these photos and reviews will be placed on every Social media site we have access to, as well as Choice Hotels, copied on this email.

The condition of our rooms was not sanitary. Not quality at all, which is unacceptable. We will never again stay in another Quality Inn & Suites again. We will encourage others not to stay at these facilities as well. People can get sick from unsanitary conditions such as these. Choice Hotels does not keep track of their hotels they are affiliated with. We stayed in Quality Inn in Owego NY and there was snot on the bed, urine stains on the sheets and feces on the toilet.

I asked her what I do with that number and she said the hotel will email me with instructions. A week went by and I didn't hear anything so I called back on /20/21 and spoke to Fernando who filed the official claim and gave me the case number . He called the hotel and Bill told him the GM was busy and to call back in an hour. Fernando told me to call back in an hour and another agent would call the hotel for me. I called Choice Hotels back an hour later and spoke to Maiden who would not call the hotel back but insisted on just giving me ,000 points and considered the issue resolved.
I have stayed at various Choice Hotels properties before and never had an issue until this one. Can this issue be solved? Thank you Just sent a message I wouldn't say I ""accepted"" the ""offer"". That agent was supposed to call the hotel for me but refused to and told me she can create a choice privileges account in my name and put ,000 points in it. I am trying to cancel and receive a refund for a  night reservation. I have a trip coming up in September to Columbus, Ohio for  nights. If you have any properties there will you give me  nights free? I would be checking in September th and out September th I didn't stay on /7. The /7/21-8/10/21 is the reservation I wanted to cancel and receive compensation for and again...I did not accept the points!! The agent, Maiden, refused to call the hotel back for me and instead created a Choice privileges account. I'm looking for a total of  nights compensation So your previous response was sent without even reading my case notes? Got it. Which reservation did that case ""resolve""? I'd like to open a new case for the other reservation. Are you offering to deposit an additional ,000 points? I agree to those terms. My Choice Privileges number is ARW4122

" Comfort Suites in Fairview Heights, Illinois needs new help. Who you've got working the front is the face of the hotel... The representative. I wasn't treated in a professional manner by your rep. I hope you remedy that. Hello and thank you for responding. I'm already in the process of speaking with your general manager at the  Ludwig Drive Fairview Heights, Illinois location. The morning attendant wants me to confirm her previously made complaints with her superiors. However, I will still give you the details on the event.

I'm very upset. Front desk attendant was very unprofessional. I don't know if you keep it dark afte at some point at night, but I didn't like how dark the lobby was upon our entrance back to the hotel this morning.

Fast forward...My sofa bed bedding didn't look clean & it was missing the sheets. I called the front desk about it & told me I had to come down to get them. I get down there for the lights to still be turned out & had to be loud alerting him to my presence, stating I was the the person who called a second ago. He emerged from the darkness & handed me the sheets from under the desk. I said, ""I also needed the blanket & pillow case. There were two in the closet with the pillow that looked, in my opinion, used."" Instead of him listening to me about it, he had an attitude. He said, ""just because it looks like it's used, doesn't mean it is."" I said, ""sir, I've stayed here & got the same bed in a bag & it was fine. I've stayed in other hotels utilizing their beds in bags for the sofa beds & had the same clean looking bedding. When it's not, I've requested new bedding."" But, in the middle of me speaking, he walks off. Not only did he have an attitude, but he walked off? Now, the polite thing to do was, at least, act like he was listening, & then tell me he would be back with my requests, but he didn't. He was dismissive. He comes back mumbling something & I say, ""what did you say?"" He says, ""we don't have pillows.""  I said, ""I didn't need a pillow. I need a pillow case because the pillow in the closet was not in its bag & appeared used."" He then says, ""we don't have pillow cases. They're all dirty."" I just stood there for a second. Then, all I could say is, ""ok.""

I left the counter upset. I'm still upset & it's :04A.M. & I'm writing a review. It's not that clean, the mildew smell, I assume, is just how it smells here. Now, we've added your attendant's funky attitude!!!

You might want to do some people skills training. The young man I encountered didn't seem to have any. It sounded like I may have interrupted something. After he walked off in the middle of my talking, I heard someone cough in the dark...I don't know...I don't care. Talk to me, & any other patron to your business, like you've got a desire to keep the job you're working. Rude service. Unpleasant demeanor.

I am not looking for compensation so that it's clear. This is my posted Google review. Didn't want to rewrite the entire situation. 
I also posted pics of how filthy our room was and a video confirming, in fact, things were how they seemed contrary to your night attendant's belief. This stay was under my sister's name: Darnella Pierce. My email address is

Ref#4340 Triple check all  properties before booking reservations. Pay attn to the ratings. Many are dives. Well, Liz, what you want to offer me is NOT even a  night stay. Pretty weak offer i would say. I dont think this is ANY way to try and earn someone's trust back. In fact, i would have to say that it is more of an insult. This is not an acceptable offer. You can speak with the franchisee and have them refund our  night stay amount, or you can give us a  night stay wherever we want within your hotel umbrella. U r wrong. Hotel and amenities were NOT used for  nights. Rez was for  nights and i paid for  nights but we checked out the very NEXT morning. No way we could stay another night in that moldy, smelly room If the books at the hotel state that we stayed p7 nights, or even  nights, they were falsified and legal action will be taken. I have tried to contact the hotel since /01 & the number is not in service. I emailed them with no response. Just bcuz the rez was for a certain number of days, doesnt mean a guest stayed all those days. I bet u find no record of me even staying bcuz i didnt sign anything. Check it out. Well, Fernando, I paid for a  night stay, and you are offering points for a  night stay. Somehow, the math does not work out to me. How does the math look to you? Like it is unequal? Thats becuase it IS UNEQUAL!! Your offer is insulting and not acceptable. I am also letting everyone I know and on all social media platforms about this negative, unacceptable and irresponsible experience. Yes, the credit card company is well aware of this situation as well. I have not asked corporate for any monetary reimbursement. If you take time to read previous messages, i asked corporate to speak with the franchisee to give me the refund.

You want me to feel good about a point compensation? I will accept a ,000 point compensation to make me feel better. A small request to make a customer feel better about your company. I booked  nights during july th weekend. Im sure each day was ,000 points.","Calvin Tom Suburban extended stay naval base in Pensacola, Fla. is a DUMP!! Its dirty, smells and the rooms have mold!

There was mold all over the bathroom ceiling and it smelled. I was two tired to do anything but sleep there. The following morning I asked that my room be changed as it gave me a headache from the mold smell. I was given another room for my granddaughters and me. The new room had some mold, but wasn't nearly as bad as the first one. I did take pictures and I showed the woman at the front desk. She said she didn't know anything about the mold problem, but they get lots of complaints. In fact while I was there another man asked for another room because of the mold in his room. My grandson gave the first room key back and I was given a new room key. When we were checking out I was asked to pay for the new room too. I explained that I only spent one night in the first room and I was given another one and the and I should only be charged the $524.16 for two rooms for two nights. The woman assured me that it was taken care of and that I wouldn't have to pay any thing else. I just got my charge card statement and I was charged an additional $120.96.

The room was disgusting, but not as disgusting as their response has been and that's saying quite a lot. Choice Hotels I've already done all of that, Grettel. I've been doing that for going on two weeks and I've been getting the same runaround. I don't want apologies or Choice points. I want my money back. Read the review and look at the pictures and tell me you wouldn't want your money back too. Read these other reviews and complaints from the country. It's not just that one location. Why would I want points to stay at another establishment to experience the same thing all over again, but at another address. Save the cookie-cutter response.

Confirmation #35382870
Arrival date :8/1/21 @  Wildwood Circle North in Homewood AL  Room . Departure date /31/21. Choice Hotels I sent the information you requested. I've sent it to everyone in your organization who has requested and the best you can offer is a canned apology and $97, when we spent over $2900 for a  day stay during the worst time in our lives and to be treated so badly. If they can cut a check for $97, they can cut one for $2900.  There were no ""amenities"" offered or used. Merely a filthy room, we came in the door cleaning, with surly unprofessional staff, who harassed us repeatedly. A room that I assure you we left cleaner than we found it. We used our own towels, soap, paper towels, toilet paper, cleansers, trash recepticles and bags, broom, vacuum and Swiffer. Disinfectant and hand sanitizers. We're still in the middle of a pandemic and housekeeping service once every two weeks was unacceptable and so was charging extra for linens was reprehensible. I've tried communicating with the local hotel to no satisfaction. My legal representation attempted to speak with them as well and they refused to speak with them. Choice Hotels yes, I read your response: ""Hi again, there! Thank you for your response. After making research in the system, we indeed found that previously ,000 points were offered, or a $97.00 check. Kindly keep in mind that the room and amenities were used for the whole reservation. We can only send the $97.00 check as a final offer. If you would like further assistance with a refund for your hotel stay, please contact the hotel directly. Alternatively, feel free to dispute the charge with your credit card company. If you accept the offer, please reply to us with your agreement, accepting either the ,000 points or the $97.00 check, along with your mailing address, phone #, and email address. We will keep an eye on your response. -Fernando""

You're whiling away your shift trolling the person who was vocal about their horrible experience. You lack empathy, a key component to good, competent customer service. But just know: you're not the only one who ""has time;"" I do too, boo.  Choice Hotels the issue of a refund might be a matter for the local billing staff where  we were staying, but this petty, insensitive response is a bad look for corporate. They've all been captured and forwarded to my legal representative. You've clearly committed yourself to being a part of the problem and not the solution. The rooms are filthy. The staff has nasty attitudes and corporate supports/ignores the dirty business dealings of the hotel that use their branding. It was a disgusting experience, all around. Robby Adams They have these same shitty practices across the country. You are not alone. They keep it real cute when they're telling you to ""eff off"" too, don't they?!?   Bobbie Marie They really are! I've gotten this same cookie-cutter response from Ed and Grettel, and a host of others. Then there was ole buddy named Fernando who went back and forth with me on another complaint thread and he kept getting ruder with each response like I was asking them to pay me my refund out of his pocket. They can't be paying him well enough for all he was doing. He was doing the most. And they are still pushing these funky  points. Then they had the nerve to offer me ""take it or leave it."" $97 after I spent almost $3k for that filthy room and their shitty service.

We arrived at :20 PM on /4 after reserving a room through the app. When I walked up to the counter, there was a note stating that the front desk would be back in the morning. It took a half hour to get a customer support person on the phone. Customer support called the emergency number and told me that the General Manager would be there in an hour to get us checked in. I had to wait  hours to get checked in to my room and it was not the GM. The hotel credited my stay, but I was never awarded the points I should've earned for booking a stay at a Choice Hotel. I had every intention of paying for my stay and I believe my account should reflect the points earned.

"Hello we were really excited to finally be here after all the wonderful things different influencers have showed and mentioned about this beautiful place. We got here about an hr ago. As you can imagine were exhausted. When I called and spoke to Rome who assisted with my reservation she was incredible. She was very kind and super super helpful with my reservation. Iam huge on customer service especially as a healthcare worker during this scary time when most are not as friendly because of the stress and fear. I completed the survey for her because you should know of such wonderful ppl you have working for you. I was just so pleased and way excited to get here with my family for a fun weekend in Disneyland Upon arrival I walked in and kindly greeting Yesenia, your front desk clerk. I advised I had a reservation. Compared to Rome, Yesenias body language was as though I was inconveniencing her. Her first words were name? I provided it ofcourse. She didnt have to greet me back I guess or maybe she didnt hear me even when I was the only one. She then asked for the payment card to be inserted. As I do so I ask for the total. She literally ignores me and says you need to hit the green button I then saw the total which I was fine with but trying to understand the difference from what Rome had given me. I asked Yesenia about it just so I understood, not disputing or anything. She says well you can pull up the booking online if you want by this time she pushed the green button for me and even the signature acknowledged the signature screen because I can assure you I did not, nor did I sign. By this time I just picked up that something was wrong with her. I proceeded to ask her if she was in a hurry. She said no. Im still trying to pull up my reservation to understand the total I had apparently agreed to since she hit the green tabs for me on the key pad and would not give me the reason for the difference. I logged into the membership acct then just stopped and told her its fine Im tired and Ill figure it out later. Not once was I rude to her, please watch the video to see her demeanor and hitting the credit card buttons for your guests. Is this normal? She seemed so in a hurry and maybe she was almost off I dont know. I just literally felt like bursting into tears being treated so poorly during such an exciting time for me and my kids. I work very very hard to be able to take these short vacations with my family. Cambria offered everything we wanted in a hotel. We typically stay at the Disney Hotel or Paradise but felt the water slides were so fun and this place is gorgeous so why not? Id like to confirm that ultimately Yesenia did provide the information she didnt provide earlier. I really wish she was a much more pleasant individual like Rome. I was so disappointed. But I think the cherry on top was when I called the front desk to ask about how to close the blackout shades. The female that answered said there should be a strong on the side. There isnt. She then put me on hold. When she returned she said shes never been in the rooms and would go check a room to check what I was talking about and call me back. Anyway its been nearly an hour and have yet to get a callback. 
I dont expect anyone to go above and beyond for me I promise but when they do like Rome did, I like to make sure and report such amazing help. I dont intend to get Yesenia in trouble but I do hope everything is ok with her and if not it shows and its impacting your guests. Im hoping the rest of our stay is much more pleasant because we were so excited and just are here to be kind and fun. Please watch the surveillance video to better understand and see for yourself. I was shocked. 
Thank you for your time. Yes  arrival /16 between -3am under Melissa Silvas Member #MXS992131

  points +  bonus points purchased on /19/21. Confirmation number 

The situation was I called to make a reservation, and the rep noticed I had some points but not enough to cover the room. They suggested I could purchase enough points to cover the room that night. So I purchased the points and then attempted to book the room. I was then told that the points were not showing on my account and that thay can happen as it may take  hours for them to post to the account. I was not told this prior to purchasing the points. As well, I have purchased points several times in the past and they have always been available immediately. So while I understand now that it can take  hours, I did not know that at the time, and I was told by the rep that I would be able to use them immediately. After purchasing those points, I no longer had enough money to buy even a very cheap room for us, so I spent a couple hours going back and forth talking to Choice customer service in various departments. I was told flat out there was nothing they could do to force the points to show up, and a refund was not possible. I asked to speak to someone higher up that may be able to help, and that request was ignored. My  and  year old children and I ended up sleeping in our car in a park and ride in a large city which was uncomfortable to say the least as well as scary.

I have previously worked for Choice as well as my dad has managed a choice hotel for nearly  years. I am a diamond member and stay in Chouce hotels as often as once or twice a week, and I recommend choice hotels to everyone I know. I have always had excellent experiences. This experience however was incredibly disappointing and upsetting. The lack of willingness to try to resolve the situation was disheartening. I feel like I was tricked into spending my money with you and once I had, no one cared. I hope i can get some kind of resolution from this even though it is over and done with.

"Who do I speak with about a nasty incident where a front desk agent at one of your hotels called me a racial slur. Will not refund my money and will not give me corporates information or anything The Melbourne FL location the front desk agent called me a stupid nigger bitch I refused to stay there after that. They refused to refund me money and to give me the number to corporate. I contacted corporate they called the location and spoke with Robin the same agent that called me a racial slur. I wouldnt recommend anyone staying with this company as theyre crooks and have racist representing their company.  hrs later and No one has reached back out to me to rectify this incident. Im extremely disappointed with this whole experience.  I arrived Sunday at :30 and never even made it to the room because as soon as she called me out of my name I asked for a refund. Her name was Robin and she called the police even had me trespass for requesting my refund. Ive never felt so degraded in my life. Then I was denied the number to corporate. Absolutely unacceptable! Ive contacted the property who basically told me they can do whatever they please in regards to refunding me my funds. I was then hung up on and told not to call back again. Robin the front desk agent that called me A stupid nigger bitch should be fired. I chose this hotel because Ive stayed with WoodSprings in other states. She is not a good representative of this brand. I will not stop here with this. It seems this has happened to a number of guest after looking at the reviews. Robin is in majority of the reviews and they all state shes prejudice. Why do they continue to keep her employee after receiving such reviews. Thank goodness my incident was caught on the polices body cam and Im retrieving that footage and will be sharing it with the news, social media and trip advisor.

I emailed the GM (from address included at top of receipt) and have yet to hear back. I have + pictures showing how disgusting, dirty, and frankly unsanitary my hotel room was (both rooms actually- as I switched rooms from cleanliness issues at check in). 

I would a full refund for this stay or I will be contacting the health department as well as the BBB concerning the conditions of the hotel. 

I was appalled at how gross the conditions of the bathroom/ kitchen especially were and I have just cancelled my upcoming reservation with them. I have the manager time to reply, hopefully rectify the issue, and perhaps give them another shot the end of the month. They did not charge me. YOU guys charged me! Otherwise I  wouldnt have a receipt from Mainstays Suites. 

Thats different than billing me. But I will, from now on, if I can help it- avoid ever booking a Choice Hotel brand property and be sure all of my business travels (an average of + nights a year) is done through other brands that value and understand and value customer service.

"My husband and I are just getting home from being on the road for a month.  Of all the hotels we stayed in (from Nevada to North Carolina and back, taking different routes to and from) the Quality Inn we stayed in in Knoxville, TN was the worst I have ever seen.  I have pics of holes in the walls, stains on towels that were suppose to be clean, cigarette burns in the sheets & bedspread, and even watched (& photo'd) a drug deal going down right outside our window.

The front desk told me to contact corporate. I have done so. After a few emails back and forth they did agree to give me back y points but are refusing to.

Why in the world would I hAve to pay for a room that the curtains were falling down, there were stains on the sheets and drips of lord knows what on the walls?!? That is why I disagreed with the resolution. My email is  I live at  Durby Ln, Foley AL  If what theyre paying out in wages for what must be a small army to respond to and address these issues was put towards improvements wouldnt we all be happier  I understand what I checked and what I agreed to. However, I did so in good faith that the accommodations would be tolerable! I didnt cancel on my own accord. I cancelled because I wouldnt ever subject my grandchild to such conditions! The thought of her crawling on that carpet was unacceptable! So your telling me there are never any exceptions to that policy. There is no upper management that understands I cancelled due to YOUR inadequacies not my own? Choice Privileges Visa.  Name on the card Lou C Bigsby. Linked to my Choice Hotel LCB2520 member number.
Thank you for your reconsideration. Im truly confused at this point about buying and using points. But Im also exhausted by this.

"Hi Choice, 
It's been a while hasn't it. I have been a member of this program for quite a while now. I just wish your franchises would abide by your brand standards. All guests should be treated accordingly whether they are club status or diamond. I have been a diamond for over a year now but I always dread securing travel accommodations because of the way I am never given consideration to my questions about the hotel and any requests or upgrades are disregarded.  And I know very well they are not overbooked...they are just being stingy when a diamond member pays for a stay and politely requests a room upgrade that showed up available when checked after the denial. The place I am referring to is the Clarion Pointe, Corydon Indiana . These proprietors need another course study in guest services. Thoughts? Look forward to hearing from you","Diamond member pays for a stay and politely requests a room upgrade that showed up available when checked after the denial.

We could not get the door to lock!! It looked like it had been kicked in numerous times. The wood and locks were all broke. Felt % unsafe! The room reeked of cigarette smoke. The TV did not work, the Wi-Fi did not work, the phone did not work. There were mouse holes in the walls. A man who could not speak English tried to get in our room.

While i was staying there and eating there I was told by everyone that this is the local whorehouse. Everybody knew including staff and bartender.  I watched hookers come in and out and i watched they're pimp who hung around the lobby coked out of his mind  nights in a row.

The room was FILTHY but the unbelievable thing was that there was HUMAN FECES! floating in my toilet. The room WASN'T cleaned, it wasn't vacuumed bobbie pins, dirt and food all over the floor. All this at any time is unacceptable but with COVID going on this made us extremely uncomfortable. Were the sheets changed, were the towels changed? We can't sleep and don't feel comfortable being there. This is costing too much for us to not want to be there!! I failed to also mention that when I asked for a manager they said they would be available in a few minutes until told them what it was regarding.

MAYBE THEY SHOULD TAKE THEIR NAME OFF THEIR ADS, SIGN OUT FRONT, SIGN IN OFFICE , AND FROM ALL PAPERWORD THAT TELLS ME i'M STAYING AT CHOICE. FUNNY, I THOUGHT THEY COULD STOP THEIVES USING THEIR NAME. No, thank you.  I went through many sessions and texts with your depth. And nothing.

Look me up in your dead files Read the remainder of this page, choice, and tell me again how concerned you are.
Ya'll make me sick Choice Hotels no sense in sending. It was a franchisee and I our company has made it clear that you have no control over them.

READ COMMENTS ON YOUR SITES.
it is immoral to allow them to treat everyone so badly and still be allowed to represent your company.

There must be something in their contract for Penalties or loss of franchise when conducting such actions.

Look me up.  Plano comfort inn last part of May to June nd Choice Hotels they. Would .not return my deposit.
When I checked in they pulled up my name but it was another jerry wheeler. If they would only check their records they probably gave him my $100, and of course he said nothing.

But these incompetent jerks would not even check only always saying WE PROCESSED IT

Maybe the did process it but to the wrong  jerry wheeler Choice Hotels +so please, no more BULLSHIT, just a good customer service with action.

I RENTED A ROOM FROM CHOICE AND CHOICE OWES ME $100.

WHEN I RESERVED THE ROOM THERE WAS NO WARNING OR Sighnage telling me it was not really choice, but a bunch of thieves be carful folks. If you have a bad experience at a frandhise locations and have a problem, your on your on,  The responds from customer service will be so sincere to help, but forgegt it .  They will eventually say they can;t interfere with how their franchisees handle their business, even stealing from their customers. NO SURPRISE WHEN I READ ALL  COMMENTS THAT VIRTUALLY  ALL COMMENTS END WITH ""AFTER SOME BACK AND FORTH WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE, THE PROBLEM STILL DID NOT GET CORRECTED""  SOUNDS LIKE A BROKEN RECORD TO ME.

May  to june  Karen S. Smiley my room was fine but they did not return my $100 deposit.  They pulled up another jerry wheeler when I signed it, so they probably sent him my $100.

"Good morning before I start a formal campaint on a multi media level I thought I would give you a chance to help. We stayed in the Comfort Suites Perrysburg Ohio Friday and Saturday night but even though our confirmation stated mobiltiy accesible room we got there and they had given it to someone else. Our confirmation number  was created on your website and paid for by our credit card. The manager that was working at the time was a Brandy Broach and she was not very helpful.  Her intial response was I can not do anything about it. What I am seeking is reinbursment for at least one of the nights stay from this trip.  We did get moved into the room that we had researved for the second night but it was not a very good experince.  Brandy was not your best respresenitive. Thank you!! Thank you.  The name on the reservation was Elena Halbeisen.  The hotel was clean and otherwise pretty good. I will say when we did finally get the accessible room it is not a true roll in. But I could have dealt that with my wifes help.  
The real issue is that we used the Comfort Inn website to reserve the room and selected the wheelchair accessible room because I am a paraplegic.  I have been in a chair  years so I am used to challenges but the response of your representative towards my wife was troubling. 
We will be traveling to Bowling Green several times over the next couple years and hate to think that our hotel options will be limited.  Please look into the policy of Orbits or others being able to override a reservation that a client made directly.  This is one of several excuses
She gave us. Then even coming all the way around and say we used a third-party. But that doesnt make sense because of what she said before that. What I am seeking is reimbursement for at least the first night and hopefully change for the future. Thank you again for replying please let me know what you can do. Fernando I will talk to my wife about your offer.  But I would like to know what you suggest when I go to book a room again. Should I use the Convenience of the website or should I call directly in to the hotel? Seems silly that you offer the rooms but can not guarantee that I will get what I need.  
I would honestly prefer the Reimbursement of the first night since it was very difficult and inconvenient for me but if points are the only option then you can double the points so it will make it worthy effort to stay at a Choice hotel again. Well the boss shot down your offer. She said she will never stay at a Choice brand hotel again.  Refund the first night is her only request. I would recommend  reviewing the reservation process. Hey Debbie why only the ?  I was unable to use the room except to barely be able to climb in the bed.  I could not shower use the toilet or anything.  How about the full amount for the one night. I accept this offer and agree.

Thank you Ed.","Fernando is a paraplegic and booked a wheelchair accessible room at the Comfort Suites Perrysburg, Ohio. He has been in a wheelchair for several years and will be traveling to Bowling Green several times over the next couple of years.

"I stayed at a comfort suites in Newport Kentucky this weekend!  I reserved two rooms. They were on the same floor. We went to a concert so when we got back it was late. We got up to the th floor and it smelled of marijuana so bad. Went into our room to sleep and at :00 I woke up to something that bite me on my back. I went into the restroom and turned the light on and several bugs (roaches)scattered on the floor.  Mice turds in the sink. I was so grossed out. I called the front desk immediately and she came up and took pictures. We had to pack our things into garage bags and left at :30 am. Which means I had to wake up the rest of my party that early to tell them what was going on and we all left. I spoke with a general manager and sent pics through email. I was informed that I could only have a refund on the one room because I didnt see anything in the other room other than a booger in the wall( which she said could be anything) needless to say I am disgusted and will never stay at a choice hotel again.

"Worst hotel ever!  We stayed at the Ames, IA location this last weekend.  Reserved and paid for our room in June but they charged us $100 more jacking our room rate up when we arrived.  Manager lied and said our reservation was incorrect but wouldnt look at my confirmation email confirming our stay.  Called corporate x  and everyone had some excuse but no reason for the rate increase.  Credit card was charged without authorized.  I was told no refunds were possible and to call my bank.  Garbage.  This hotel is the worst.  Had to ask for clean linen and the toiletries in our cleaned room had already been used.  Ridiculous. We stayed at the Ames location Oct  through the th.  The manager Bonnie Alley provided the worst customer service.  I was told my reservation was only booked for  nights which was why I was charged another $100.  Even though, I have the confirmation email showing my reservation and payment for  nights.I have documentation from phone calls with corporate showing the same thing.  She was rude and not helpful and then refused to speak to me after that.  She wouldnt even take calls from Corporate when asked.  I was told before I left by the front desk that the rate was what I had paid for back in a June.  However as soon as we left my credit card was manually entered and charged the extra $100.  I was told my reservation couldnt be changed or cancelled.  If thats the case, then why did my rate change for no reason?  I couldnt change my reservation but an employee did back in July increasing my rates.

This as the worst experience.  I had the opportunity to stay in your chain of hotels in Seattle the next day.  I wouldnt stay in or ever recommend this hotel.  Ever.  And the manger needs to be fired for her lack of customer service or doing her job.  Making the front desk staff be the go between and lying to me about what my reservation shows without ever looking at my documents.  Just dismissing me.  Terrible. All of these images are from my June th reservation and payment.  It shows  nights.  Paid for  nights.  Please refund my money of the extra $100 that was charged.

For my inconvenience I would like more than that refunded.  Even the hotel staff when I checked in, Thiago?  Agreed that this should be allowed to be cancelled.  Please fix this situation. Sent.  Ive been trying to obtain information on how to reach the owner to try and get this resolved as the manager that works there wont speak with me or look at my reservation.  Im sure glad you guys promote the pineapples there as a sign of hospitality.  I think there should be a training in what that actually means. Thanks but no thanks.  Why would I want to run the risk of staying at this line of hotels after this experience?  Like I said, I wont ever stay with Choice and will let everyone I know what kind of treatment your hotels provide.  Individually owned or not, its still under one name: Choice.  I choose not to support a corrupt business that steals money from people. Please provide the contact information to someone higher up at that hotel so I can continue to try and get my money back.  Thank you. No thanks.  A place shouldnt be able to raise the rates after you make a pay for a reservation.  Thats why you make a reservation. Corporate is no help.  Please give me the information for the owner of that hotel. Ive tried talking to Bonnie.  She wont look at my my confirmation email or assist me. Someone has to have the information for her boss. Wow.  Glad that this whole time, over a week, corporate acted like they could help me since that hotel is worthless.  Thanks for wasting my time and money.

"I was would like to let you know about my stay /14-10/18 at the Quality Inn in Orlando Florida.   Please forward this to the proper people.
  There was no chair in the room.  I had to go to the front desk to ask for a chair as I could not call down as there was also no phone in the room.  There was also no alarm clock, iron or ironing board.  All of these items were supposed to be in the room according the web site  Amenities.  When someone brought up a chair, it was dirty and had unknown stains on it.  I sat on a towel on the chair as the chair was so disgusting that I didn't want to touch it.   
  The faucet in the bath tub leaked and could not be turned off.  The constant dripping noise was only drowned out by the clanking of the AC unit.  
   There were actual sheet rock screws holding up broken bath room tiles and the shower rod as well as holding the toilet paper holder together.  The paint was pealing off of the walls. 
 The light on the bathroom ceiling was just an exposed bulb in the fixture.  The was no covering on it.  The bathroom exhaust fan did not work. 
  On Saturday night there was a constant flow of cars coming and going as if they were renting rooms ""by the hour""
  On Sunday morning the back parking lot was littered with numerous small zip top type baggies which are commonly used for drug paraphernalia and Sunday afternoon/evening there was a group of men sitting on the outdoor stairs smoking weed.  
  I have stayed at choice hotels on numerous occasions in the and have never seen a worse hotel.  I know that I will never stay at this hotel again and am not sure about staying at any other  Choice Hotels in the future.  Had there been other hotels in the area with vacancies I would have cancelled my reservation and gone elsewhere.  It most certainly was not what I was expecting based on my previous Choice Hotel stays and was not worth anywhere close to what I paid for my stay The stay I am referring to was /14-10/18 at the Quality Inn on  International Dr.  in Orlando Florida.  The reservation was in my name, Christopher Newins Confirmation Number:   All of the issues in my first PM to you were ALL from this stay,  Thank You and I look forward to hearing back from you.

 So I guess expecting a clean toilet upon check in will get you kicked out for being too picky. Literally sleeping in the car even tho I cleaned the toilet myself. What?!  Im sleeping in a parking lot cuz  kicked me out and threatened to call the cops cuz I complained that my toilet hadnt been cleaned. Im alone scared and venting.   #notsleeping   They threatened to call the cops on me cuz I was complaining at the front desk and other customers could hear me.   Yea the managers the one that said shed call the cops and I need to just leave town cuz obviously I cant be pleased. I dont think choice cares. Sad.  Got a refund but Id rather have a clean room to sleep in.   Lol I appreciate ya. All the area hotels are booked for some event. Which they knew and still had no problem kicking me out for their mistake.    Lol I appreciate ya. All the area hotels are booked for some event.

"I had the displeasure of booking a room at the Econolodge in Wickliffe, Ohio last night.

The pictures below represent the room that I was assigned to. I immediately had to check out and go find another room in town late at night. I am extremely dissatisfied with Choice hotels at the moment. This is inexcusable, and a health and safety hazard! Now I have to wait  days for the funds to show back up in my account as well. This hotel should be ashamed of itself. That room has not been cleaned in years! And the sheets on the bed were obviously used The arrival date was yesterday /22/21, and my name is Jamie Sell. I paid for the room, and after viewing it - subsequently asked for a refund and left.

Been staying at a woodspring suites for over  days for work and they told us they dont do the tax exempt here.  also been here going on  weeks and our bed was made once. Didn't even clean the room. Price gouging because of the hurricane and what I'm paying I'd think my room could  at least get cleaned. We are staying at the woodspring suites in sulpher Louisiana. We checked in on September th  and are still there in the same room. It's been over  days and we plan to be there at least another  to  weeks. I thought after  days you should be tax free but the manager told us no. Also the only room cleaning we had was one time after two and half weeks of us asking we got our beds made with the same sheets and pillow cases. Name of the room is reserved under Brandon Lancour. Also was told this woodspring suites doesn't participate in choice rewards? What's about the taxes after  days?

Noblesville Indiana  Yes, but as a customer i didnt know that. So is there anything that you can do to give me points for that stay. I was looking forward to do a booking in NY in the coming weeks and thought could use some points for the same. Hello, Goodmorning 
Further to the trailing discussion, i would like to let you know that i have checked out from the hotel. Can you please reevaluate my case and let me know of a positive solution.
hoping for the best

"The Asheville Dowtown Quality Inn Hotel has such rigid cancellation policies during a time where reserving rooms are risky due to so much going on. Customer service will add a few points to your account and then try to sell you a credit card to use and call that resolution. Horrible customer service.  I get you cant just cancel a reservation. What I dont get is why not offer a credit for future stay? Nope. Just take the money and lose customers. Downtown Asheville. No flexibility at all during times when travel is a bit risky any way. Choice Hotels . I was told this was the policy and I was given  points on my rewards. I was also given the opportunity to get a credit card with your company which I declined.  Not sure why things have to be in private message since this is company policy.  The manager at this location stressed that there was no one above her and the matter was closed.  I appreciate that but to use those I would be spending more money with a company that I do not agree with their policy of keeping almost $500 that I feel could have easily been given in future credit for stay. I want to thank you for reaching out and trying to make what I feel is wrong better. I will accept your offer. It makes it less distasteful for me knowing that the corporate office is willing to try and make a customer feel better even if the manager would not. Just let me know what I have to do to accept the offer and I will let it go. I obviously wont be booking at the downtown Asheville Quality Inn but hope for a better experience at another.

"The GM from Chattanooga sent me an email after my survey. The basic formal informal apology wasn't acceptable. I have been a Choice member for  years and a Barclay card holder.

My name is Jeremy C. McKendree, I did not have a confirmation number that I am aware of. I checked in at the desk when I arrived? At nine am in the morning on the th day of October . My wife and I started getting ready to leave the hotel and head home. We had talked about how the room smelled like urine all night and how unkempt the hotel bathroom was. I had went into the bathroom to get washed up and went to blow dry my hair and the blow dryer caught on fire (a literal flame three inches high) was blowing out of the dryer and then it exploded in my face. A piece of the dryer went into my eye and I was trying to figure out how to put the fire out because the dryer would not shut off. I was going to put it in the sink but knew I would be shocked or something worse. So I held the dryer and unplugged it from the wall. I held it till it cooled off and quit smoking. I reported it to the front desk as I was leaving. I've have ,000 points and will not be staying at another Choice property.  Thank You for the offer and your concern for your members.

"    Yeah thats how I booked it. Through the CH app. Good idea.  Hello?  Please see this tweet. Was told a manager would return my wifes call to discuss a refund. That was /24. Still waiting. I will get this info asap. As for the incident, it was described in my initial tweet. There were intoxicated people screaming through the hallways around AM for about  minutes, and then again around :30AM for approx -20 minutes. My wife called the front desk twice, about  minutes apart, and both calls went unanswered. Upon checkout, the woman at the counter mentioned that there was a disturbance in the hallways and my wife said she would be calling the manager in hopes to get a refund for the repeated inconvenience. She called on /24 and as I said, was told the manager was not available at the moment but would call her back shortly. They did not. She called back on /25 and was told the same thing. No one has called. This has now been over  weeks and still no response. No refund. No apology. Nothing. I have been a Choice Hotels customer for many years. I will no longer be using Choice until this is resolved and refunded. I gave the hotel location in my initial tweet. Woodspring Suites, Bethlehem PA (4016 Christian Spring Rd).

"To whom it may concern: I just checked out of your hotel in Scottsdale, AZ, the Papago Inn. While most of the stay was ok, my experience to end my visit was so terrible I may never stay at a Choice Hotel again. I would offer feedback through your website but I assume that if I submit feedback on a specific hotel it goes to the hotel GM and my poor treatment was at the hands of the general manager so that is not an option. For your reference my confirmation number was  and I stayed checked in on Monday, November  and checked out today, Saturday, November . I was told that checkout time was noon, but in an attempt to be courteous to the cleaning staff and because I needed to return my rental car I was out of the hotel around :30. I did leave my suitcase at the front desk as my flight is not until this evening and I wasn't ready to go to the airport. I returned my car around noon and walked the handful of blocks back to the hotel with the plan to find somewhere to sit and get some work done before departing for the airport. When  I returned to the hotel I was told a couple of places where I could sit and work but first I needed a restroom. I asked where a restroom I could use was and was told there was not one. Without getting too far into detail I was in a situation where I needed a restroom. This was not a situation where I just wanted to go freshen up. The Papago Inn is in an area largely surrounded by apartments and  car dealerships. There weren't many options for another place to go. I mentioned to the woman at the front desk (who turned out to be the GM) that I had just spent about $500 there and the past  nights. I simply needed a restroom. She said that there was nothing she could do. I asked about the attached restaurant's restroom and she said it has been closed since COVID started. She wasn't allowed to let people any restroom. I asked if there was one nearby and she told me that I could go to the Circle K down the street maybe half a mile. This wasn't a satisfactory response, but as I mentioned I needed a restroom so with no car I started walking to the nearby Circle K. A little while later I arrived at the Circle K and was told that they didn't have a public restroom either (I hadn't spent any money there so that was an entirely different situation). At this point I left and started back to the hotel. I called the front desk and the same woman answered. I reiterated that I needed a restroom and ask whether this was an issue related to COVID protocols. I have family that works in healthcare and have taken COVID very seriously. I continue to wear a mask indoors and am fully vaccinated with my booster. The manager said that it is a COVID issue at which point I mentioned that if they are concerned about COVID maybe they should consider requiring masks for their staff as I hadn't seen any staff with a mask on since I arrived at the hotel. This really set her off and she began absolutely screaming at me. I may not have handled the situation well myself but her behavior was unacceptable from someone who I had just spent $500 with and a full  days giving business. Again, my suitcase was at the front desk so I decided to return to the hotel, plead one more time for access to a restroom and go from there. When I returned to the hotel the manager hid in the office, trying not to give me any service. I asked loudly if I could at least get my bag. She came out and gave me my bag screaming at me the whole time then rushed out of the lobby, reminding me I was on camera as she went. I had a family member on the phone through this last stop at the Papago Inn and in response I said I had done nothing illegal or wrong. I just needed a restroom. I decided from that point that I would take my bag and get an Uber to the airport  hours early for my flight so that I could use a restroom at the airport. I stepped outside the lobby into the driveway and waited in the parking lot for my Uber and left for the airport. This was a very simple situation. There were a variety of ways it could have easily been resolved. Again, all I needed was either access to a restroom or a nearby place where I could go to get access. The Choice Hotels affiliated hotel GM refused to give me either. Sending me to a location that didn't have a restroom and then berating me when I became upset and panicked. After  nights at a hotel when I was as low maintenance of a guest as possible. I didn't require anything. When my floor mat for outside my shower looked dirty I didn't mention it and when the hotel phone had no power cord I called to the desk on my cell to let them know that I didn't need the phone but wanted them to be aware of the issue. When the free wireless wasn't working and I couldn't access the internet with my computer I called down to the front desk, asked if something was wrong with it. The front desk employee said it was working fine for him and I moved on. This experience was an absolutely terrible way to end a trip and leaves an awful taste in my mouth. I should also mention that I asked if there was a manager I could speak to or who I could reach out to and was told that she was the manager. I asked if there was a general manager and she told me that was her as well. I asked who I could speak to above her and she said ""That would be the owner and they are out of state so you can't talk to them."" I recognize that Choice Hotels is a massive company and many of the hotels are franchised, but the Papago Inn is listed as part of the Choice Hotels family and I can tell you that this reflects extremely poorly on the entire corporation in my eyes. When I travel I have many options for hotels. I chose a Choice Hotel this time and may not again.",The Papago Inn is in an area largely surrounded by apartments and car dealerships.

Waited an hour then when no shuttle had arrived like the other hotels that rotate, I started calling. I called  times from my phone. Used one of the airport police officers phone and called  times. Nobody would answer. And when they did all you could hear was laughing or typing on a keyboard in the background or silence.

"Hi im a choice member and I would just like to let you know I will never be using choice hotels again and I will be using my platform and telling everyone I know to do the same. 

I have a friend who travelled to the Rodeway Inn in Colorado Springs and her personal information was provided to a male staff member who proceeded to contact her. Not even the minimum of a refund was provided to her. 

We have contacted local news media and will be taking this to our contacts in DC because this behavior is absolutely unacceptable. Women should be reasonably safe at your establishments and we have received the message loud and clear that women will not be protected in your spaces. 

I am relentless and will not give up. I will tell everyone I know not to use your establishments especially women. I will contact bigger platforms as well as advocacy groups to hold you guys accountable. No one should have to pay to be violated. And you providing personal information to predatory staff members and not even refunding your guests is indicative of your priorities as a company. 

I assure you this will not be the last you hear about this situation, but as of today you lost year another guest, who once spoke highly of your company and intended to use your establishments for business. 

I hope you guys feel secure in your choice to dismiss what could have ended in a dangerous encounter and making it clear that the privacy of your clients will not be respected. As I feel secure in mine pursuing this relentlessly as I do not stand for the commodification of women.

"Hello Choice Hotels!!  you guys replied to my post on a YouTube video of one of your hotels. I actually go around to all of your hotels rating and reviewing them. From the food to the staff to the rooms! I currently work for you guys so I use my employee discount to review and rate these properties. I would give you guys the information of this hotel but I'm currently working on a video where I waited four hours for the front desk to come into my room smell marijuana smoke in my bathroom. By the time the front desk lady got up to my room, she then started accusing me of smoking in the room and searched all of my things illegally looking for smoking devices which she found nine and it's all on video and I'm posting it on YouTube So I don't think you want that properties information this YouTube video was posted a while ago. I wanted to expose what property this is on my YouTube cause I called the front desk four times and waited for hours and lost my job because she took so long to come up and smell my bathroom! Like I said then started accusing me of smoking in the room when the snow is gone by then! This front desk employee has been working every single day  hours a day so she's on a power trip and I do not appreciate it as an employee or a member After I recorded her of  things in my room and complaining about marijuana smoke, they refuse to let me book anymore So this is now a personal attack I have so many videos of all of your properties I'll tag you guys in more of them  Wowww  
 I didn't want to have to post this but you guys left me no option! We could have settled this in the DM that you told me to send it to you! I'll take the video down when you compensate me with $250 that I was falsely accused of smoking in!!  More videos to come of me calling them x in  hours asking for help! I GOT CHARGED $250! For reporting smoke in my room? Was trying to let them know to make this a better Hotel!  stopped replying to me instead of FIXING THIS ISSUE! LIKE USUAL! ALL ABOUT MONEY AGAIN!

I have so many videos of so many hotels with so many good reviews! Just recently this one rubbed me wrong and has illegal activity. I'll remove it if you guys come and see me and cuz I literally I am two seconds about to call my lawyer Or we can become friends and I can post all the wonderful videos that I have of many hotels that I've stayed in for you guys!! Mainstay Sleep Inn & Suites by the airport in Denver.... Ill get the girls name for you.... she told me that you guys are over working her  hours a day  days a week! So apparently somebody is on the power trip and think they run everything! Including searching my things!!! And found NOTHING After losing one of my jobs waiting  hours for her while throwing up Than God I'm a vlogger and record EVERYTHING  I have posted other hotels on my YouTube cuz I only stay with Choice Hotels. I can continue to do this for you guys but after the last experience and being charged falsely $250 and you guys aren't doing anything about it is not right     Cassandra Paul  I replied! Please check your messages!!  Here's the link to your employee abusing ME of smoking in the room after calling her x & waiting for hours for her to come up to smell my bathroom! By that time I had lost my job. She's trying to cover her ass & turn it on me! $250 I had to pay for what?!  Here's the link to your employee abusing ME of smoking in the room after calling her x & waiting for hours for her to come up to smell my bathroom! By that time I had lost my job. She's trying to cover her ass & turn it on me! $250 I had to pay for what?!  Also, I stayed here for much longer,  but they put me into a  bedroom & changed my employee reservation which I KNOW IS AGAINST THE RULES!! It will not be in the system, but I have the conf# emails. I have many more videos of me calling them multiple times for  hours!  Or you guys can do the right thing and compensate me. Then I will go around to your hotels reviewing and rating them and putting them on my YouTube. All of my videos are of your hotel so far and Motel . I just haven't mentioned it in the description or tagged you guys yet.  Or you guys can do the right thing and compensate me. Then I will go around to your hotels reviewing and rating them and putting them on my YouTube. All of my videos are of your hotel so far and Motel . I just haven't mentioned it in the description or tagged you guys yet. Both They are connected They are in the same building It's a new property by the Denver airport          I've stayed at this hotel(s) SO MANY TIMES!! There's that one girl that told me ALL HER PROBLEMS like you guys are working her  hours a day,  days a week and told me it was illegal for you guys to make her work like that. I'll be happy to post happy videos of all your hotels, which I have already ALL OVER my YouTube. This is what I do. I go to hotels and review and rate them on YouTube. Everything was fine until this girl made me wait  hours (and after  phone calls-all recorded and ready to post on YouTube) so I couldn't relieve my manager at the other choice hotels I worked at, and got fired. I have a video of me calling her, and she was up within  minute!!!!! Lazy workers yelling at everyone in the hall ""who's smoking"" very unprofessional I'll get her name for you tomorrow Other than that, never had a problem with ANY of your hotels as you can see on my YouTube! That was my favorite hotel too. Beautiful hotel! Shit staff!!! So horrible hotel!  more videos I have exposing your wonderful sweet employee   Called then x in  hours to come smell the smoke! Then I GET ACCUSED?? AFTER GETTING FRED, WAITING  HRS TO SHOWER, THEN SHE IGNORES THE DAMAGE IN THE ROOM???  On a lighter note
.. here's quality inn... More hotel room tours I do silly videos like this to show how nice the hotel is... So if you guys want to sponsor me and we can talk directly if there's a problem instead of posting it on YouTube, I'm all for it! I'm a positive person and I love choice hotels I'm not going to let this one bad worker ruin it for me.... unless that's how you guys want to handle things as a business employer Here's your queen again working  hours at this hotel so she thinks she can be lazy, give excuses for everything and then flip the script on people when I was trying to let her know so she can charge whoever was smoking! I'm about to post on Google, ""Don't report smoke or they will charge you $250!"" I haven't exposed you guys yet. Only this one video on my YouTube uploaded today. Lmk if you guys want her name    I've been messaging you guys ALL DAY! CHECK YOUR MESSAGES & STOP TELLNG ME TO CHECK MINE LIKE YALL DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ISSUE! BE CAREFUL THIS COMPANY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY & MAKE YOU SPEND  HRS TRYING TO GET A REFUND! IF U GET ! I'VE BEEN SEXUALLY HARRASSED  Buy a maintenance worker. There's this one hotel and every room I checked in has something wrong with it to where the maintenance worker had to come into the room to see who was in there cuz he a pedophile & he told me he was!

"This is what my TV was like my whole stay at Quality Inn, Bangor Maine while visiting my elderly parents. 
This was only one small problem of many.  I wrote a review regarding the hotel. Im not sure what youre going to resolve considering there are multiple bad reviews. Its the Quality Inn in Bangor Me. I tried uploading pics but it wouldnt let me. . The staff was excellent. 
The staff deserves better. 
Never again. So this was my table. 
The heater if put on high or any length of time sounded like a jet was landing next to your room. The bathmat was so dirty it was slimy. I had to ask house keeping to play clean the bathroom. Mind you this was my nd room. The first smelled like smoke. And not just a little, i had the same problem with the heater. 
My light next to the bed was bent so when turning on or off Im surprised it didnt fall. So long as it stays this way I wouldnt recommend anyone staying here and I have family here so they will listen and tell their friends. 
My bedspread was stained. The mattresses were nice and the refrigerators were clean. What staff I did see were nice. 
This quality inn is on hogan rd, Bangor Maine.  Ps, the dials do not turn so theres only the setting you get when turned on.  Sent you a DM. Oh, o forgot to mention the TV. It constantly froze. Now I have Directv at home and I never have this issue. Until last night it was clear outside. Also the tv had a black line going thru it. Pixels must be gone. My friend had the same experience who stayed in another room. While he paid for my room with his points Im reimbursing him. It cost around $350 for the  days. His name is Dennis Michaud. He will be calling. He said hes never had this experience b4. Thats saying something. No it is not resolved. Im getting the info from my friend who had a bad stay at this hotel as well. Im trying to get info Bc he used his points to pay for my room. DXM

Hello, thank you for getting back to me! I have stayed at this property many times over  years. It has always been a wonderful experience. However, my stay last week was far less than that! I was in room  Tuesday- Friday. I checked in, the room had a smell, the tile and light fixture in the bathroom were disgusting, the shower head was black. I spent Friday out of the hotel and returned to find a bag of chips had been chewed (I am assuming a mouse or something similar!) I immediately went to the desk explained this, showed a photo and asked for a new room. The girl working said she would need to call her manager before this could happen. I was moved to a new room, with the smoke detector hanging off the wall. I asked the front desk how to reach the manager to discuss this and no one would provide me with that information. Incase you need a photo for proof Thank you so much! I appreciate that. My member number is , phone number -421-5882,  and P.O. Box  Beachville ON N0J A0.

Over a month ago I came homethe room and found my mother on the floor dead. And that was the last time I have been in that room.
Not by choice tho
Manager at Woodspring Extended Stay on Stalh drive informed me for the st and and only time that I am not allowed in the room.
The room I lived in  for years which contains everything I owe. As well as Mothers belongings. The day I found my mother on the floor I was forced to leave with clothes on my back and my cats in carriers. After multiple calls to manger to please allow me some personal items or anything from room the answer is still no.
Then I found out they boxed up everything in the room. And the manager went on to say. She personally boxed up the room and did everything by the book.
Not long after she boxed up everything in the room by the book
My mothers phone which was in the room I wasnt allowed in ended up in Kentucky. Few calls later its been sold to a kiosk by someone. If she boxed up everything by the book then how is it mothers phone was in Kentucky?
I was told since I was staying there I owe half of the bill. 
Then the same manager tells an officer that she wont allow me in room because I dont have a key and my name isnt on the room.so please think of this if any of you or anyone you know who may know who might be thinking about staying there Woodspring Extended Stay on Stalh Road.. I lost my mother and everything I own and have not been allowed in room.

"I stayed at the Comfort Inn at  E Iliff Ave, Aurora, CO  on Thursday night,  December . I reviewed this stay yesterday. Along with all the lowest rankings, I wrote: 
There was a ""masks required"" post on the front doors. None of the staff wore masks. None of the people staying there, except me, wore masks. I had to wipe down my hotel room with disinfectant wipes because it was obvious that counters were sticky, walls were dirty, door handles had hand oil on them, etc. 
I couldn't eat breakfast, which I paid for, because none of the staff setting it up were wearing masks. 
You put my health at risk in the middle of a worldwide pandemic. You made it clear that you don't care and don't respect everyone's right to be safe. I am angry I paid you to have my health jeopardized.  
Do you not read the news? Do you not want to protect your employees as much as your patrons? My experience tells me you just don't care who gets sick and who dies. 
I am disgusted with Comfort Inn.

Below is what you responded this morning. It is a stock reply that tells me you did not read my review and, again, that you don't care to do anything better or to protect people. And, I will not consider staying with you again. You should refund my money and apologize, as well as clean your hotel and require masks. Seriously, what is wrong with you that you think you are exempt from doing the right thing?

On /13 I booked a room with Sleep Inn & Suites Denver International Airport.  The room was for my son.
Confirmation # 

When my son went to check in they would not allow him to stay because he was only  years old.  There is absolutely no notification of this hotel policy anywhere on their website. I've searched exhaustively. 

Upon speaking with the General Manager Jonny she informed me it was a policy and there was nothing she would do. I explained he was checking in  alone ( afraid he was going to  have a party), enrolled in College, and an honor student. 

So, at :30 PM with a temperature of  Degrees, my son was literally stranded on the side of the road. Please understand I'm ,000 miles away and unable to help him. Rest assured, he's in peril and should something happen you'll hear about it

A reply would be nice Sorry for the delayed response. I myself was traveling from Japan to the US. The Name on the Reservation was Satchel Prairie.  His date of Arrival was /16/21. Departure /17/21.  The Hotel was the sleep inn and suites.  North Tower Road Building B, Denver, CO , USA He had no mode of Transportation as he was dropped off at the hotel by the airport shuttle. I begged and Pleased with the hotel GM and even offered to put ,000USD security deposit on my credit card.  I got a hard NO. He was running low on funds and didn't have the USD he was quoted by Uber to get him to a Denver at that time of night. He ended up ""sleeping"" outside ( behind a row of bushes for safety) in temperatures below  degrees. Fortunately he had a hat and mittens. IF A HOTEL HAS A POLICY OF NOT ALLOWING A PERSON UNDER  TO STAY TEHRE IT SHOULD BE CLEARLY STATED ON THEIR WEBSITE. ( or even n fine print). #ChoiceHotelsHeartless! If it happened to me I could deal with it. However, when it happens to a family member, and I am powerless to do anything to assist at the time it's heartbreaking. Yes Grettel, I understand some of your hotels might have age restriction policies.  However, don't you think it would be prudent to publicly state that policy? Prior to booking online I diligently  scoured their website. There is no mention of such a policy. The result was my son sleeping on the streets in below freezing temps. ( Way below) Hi Grettel - I can see you and Choice Hotels are all about delivering PERSONAL satisfaction. My name is Shane. My son's name is Satchel.  Earlier in this thread you called me Mathew ""Good morning, Matthew! "". Now You've asked me to send you Casandra's member number, address, ph number and email. WHO IN THE HELL IS CASANDRA?  Your attention to detail is impeccable. I'm going to ask that you keep your ,000 points and send me a name of a customer service rep that can address the issue i'm seeking clarity on.  Thank you,   Shane Prairie Hello Ed, Sorry for not promptly replying. I'm currently enjoying the holiday week with my family and they are my priority. To be frank, this issue has been causing me nothing but stress, and i've been trying to forget that one of your hotels wouldn't allow my son to stay in their property, but had no problem with him sleeping outdoors in Denver, Colorado where the temperatures were in the teens. However, the ,000 Choice points will more than make up for his/our hardship.         ( Please note sarcasm). Choice Member since . Membership number

Room  has water stains on the ceiling, the shower arm comes out the wall and even when I pushed back in, it popped right back out.  There is blue splatters of something on the ceiling.  The bed is comfortable and the room appeared clean. The biggest concern I have is the motel advertises they serve a full breakfast...not at all.  they had scrambled eggs, coffee, juice, and a couple sweet rolls and pork sausage.  Nothing else.  Nothing else   nothing else.  The friendly clerk, said their supplier is not able to provide them with the food and supplies.  I responded proper management would go to the store and buy those things and besides other motels have the stuff.  No napkins, no tea, no fruit, no butter, no waffles, no syrup.  No gift for elite members.  The friendly clerk said they were out.  No yogurt.  No milk.  no cereal.  NOTHING.  The internet works good. A safety concern. The cement step on the side door entrance toward back of hotel is missing. So its approximately two feet to step up or down onto the cement platform to enter or to exit that part of the hotel Arrived /19/21.  Confirmation .   Karen Franke Please note the two staff in which I interacted were friendly. They just were not able to provide because management failed to purchase or make the side entrance safe They wont give me the  points for being an elite member. They say its their choice each hotels can choose to give or not.  I showed the manager the app and it showed diamond member  she said its their right to give or not. They choose not As I was checking 
Check out I asked if the night clerk had given me the extra points for being an elite member they told me I was not an elite member I wasnt a member at all he said I did not book through Choice which is not accurate I did I walked out as the lady was trying to explain to me and help me to understand that the motel is independently owned and run and therefore they can do what they want to do and it doesnt matter what Choice has in place they make their own decisions she was very nice as she tried to get me to understand I will send info when I get home.

"Hello, this is Annjela. My case no is , it has been  and a half months trying to get this resolved with you guys. I have called and emailed numerous times. To call you guys and talk to someone, explain everything takes approximately an hour so I do not have that time every day to follow up. The last person I spoke to few weeks back was supposed to have someone call me the next day but no one called. You guys do not really care reaching back to your customers. Pls take your time and review my case. Your people are offering me  points, in the first place I do not want to be associated with your hotel so I did not want the points but few months back when I spoke to one of your customer service agent, he was nice enough to offer me all the  some thousand points, you have to understand that we were  adults who took two rooms and stayed for  nights. We were humiliated, ill treated, discriminated. I was given your corporate emails and phone no but no one answers the phone and the email bounces back. I am beyond upset at this point but I will not leave it at this. Either you want me to go public or seek legal help on this. This is the last time I am reaching out to you to let you resolve my issue.  /2 months is a long time and you are really trying my patience. Hello Zaira, thank you for responding quicker than expected. Its a shame that you guys keep offering me -10,000 points. I did not accept  some thousand points the agent offered me few months back. I feel humiliated each time you guys do this and I have to explain everything all over again and the experience comes back as a nightmare. Btw I was not alone, as i mentioned before. We were  adults and stayed for  nights and had booked  rooms. If you cannot offer me ,000 points. Pls send me details of your corporate office with a valid email and phone no. I do not want to waste my energy anymore on this issue. You are simply underestimating the situation. Otherwise refund me all the money I paid for the hotel. I do not want to be associated with choice hotels if you guys keep pushing me. So you are offering me  per person correct? like i mentioned, you guys only humiliate me more every time i contact you. I am not here to bargain. So do me a favor and give me your corporate office phone no and email. As always, i have to spend so much time just talking to you guys. If its  per person i will take otherwise forward this to someone higher. You were not with me or my family so you wouldnt understand. And I am not reaching out to claim my points on what I spend, mind you I never asked for points, someone in your company offered. Zaira, the number you have given a above is your customer service, where I have called many times. That number, the email and this chat is not where my problem is going go be solved, so pls send me your corporate number and email where I can reach out to someone higher. Thank you You make the reservation under one name if it is a family but clearly my reservations show  adults, and my elderly mother and husband both were equally affected by the experience. The most unacceptable service ever received from Choice Hotels. Its almost  months now and you guys have wasted my time going back and forth communicating via email, phone, private facebook message. Pls pass me your head of dept email or contact because your unreasonable discussion over me and my familys experience is getting no where. Choice Hotels - Zaira, ofcourse you did, but I do not agree with anything you are offering on the private message. I do not want your points, I never did in the first place. Let me talk to someone higher. Thank you Its almost  months now. You have wasted my time and energy just with the communication back and forth. Me and my family were discriminated. I had to tend and go back and forth to tend to my mother because of the inconvenience. In front of my eyes, one of the other stuff at the hotel gave my husband the key on the rd day and said she would accommodate us next to my mothers room. But then in few mins she took the key back and told my husband someone booked the room so she couldnt accommodate us. I had booked the same room in the first place but because I am not white, your staff who were both white decided they could give more preference to white people? We were humiliated more than once, mind you. And this is just one of the incidents I have mentioned. If you go and read my case, you should see more details. And you are valuing this to $147.60? We were  adults equally involved. I tried to stay out writing this publicly, thinking you guys would solve this issue, but I believe you pay attention when you only go social, right? And on Christmas eve, you still want me to spend time going back and forth trying to solve this issue. I think you can do much better, having said you are at the highest level. Since I had two rooms booked for  adults- and you are giving me back $147.60 for one night. Why dont you give $147.60 x  and close this long argument. I really do not wan to take this to the new year. You have to understand my frustration as its taking so long for you to solve this issue. You guys make me laugh. How would my matter be resolved. I do not have time every day to spend in communicating with you guys because you guys really do not care. I have learned that discrimination and ill treatment means nothing to your company. So after wasting  months you ask me to go back to the hotel? I paid choice hotels, I did the booking directly with you guys, why dont you contact the hotel and dispute all the charges. I do not have extra time to do that. You have not solved my issue. Seems like you dont treat people well. I tried to be patient and waited for this long but seems like I will have to seek legal advice on this. Can you suggest on what basis would I dispute this with the credit card company? This is not their fault. I am not seeking refund to the credit card. I am filing a complaint on other basis with Choice Hotels as I booked and stayed in your hotel. I know you are not the highest level of this complaint and you are not willing to give me the information either. You are justing wasting both yours and my time going back and forth, causing me extra stress. Compensate me for twice the amount you have stated. This was for  adults who got affected- pls remember that. Hello, do you guys check the account issue or just handle complaints? It says i have an account but am not able to log in. I want to check my status before i go ahead and end this issue. Thats alright. I called to sort this out. I am really really tired of dealing with you guys so since you offered me points or cash. I will take the points. My member number is AXB105732 so pls just deposit the points there. And pls know I am not happy but for my own peace of mind I want to end it here and take this issue any further So earlier you offered me $74 or  points and you went up to $147.60. How many points are you giving me for almost  months of struggle? If you calculate, hope it is more than . If it makes sense. Its so difficult to communicate with you guys. Pls just deposit the points in my account and why do you want my mailing address. I already provided you my member no. Pls scroll up to see message. You guys are utterly time and energy consuming. What do you mean by once we have this information, we will follow up with your inquiry ??? You guys dont have my home address, why do u need it further? How will u verify if you dont have it? I can send you my email and phone no My address:  Chastain Cir, Newnan, GA, 

Email: 

Phone:  Thank you but just so you know you never rectified my bad experience. Just coz I do not want to take this negative feeling towards the new year I wanted to end this here. Besides the experience it took almost  months of additional stress for me.

Miami, Florida 

Tasha Blumenberg 
Booking number: WGR5DB

Checked in: /22/2021 approximately :00 pm

Desk clerk name: Amantha 

Traveling with a family to a city youre not familiar with during the holidays comes with stress. Thats a given. However, I work hard to do my due diligence when making travel plans and so prior to booking a hotel I read several reviews and narrowed my choices down by location, reviews, Anne iTunes and price. Then I called each hotel to confirm the advertised hotel shuttle from the airport and to the Port of Miami. I was chose Comfort In. Because the reviews donned cleanliness, family friendly and shuttle service was reliable. I then called the hotel on /92021 called to confirm airport and port shuttle service was available and how it worked. I was told to put my name on the list when I checked in. Although Comfort Inn was more expensive than the competitors I was shopping, I was satisfied with the responses I received and justified the extra money given the amenities. On /10/2021 I booked a room and paid in advance. 

On /22/ I arrived for check in at the hotel and when I asked to add our name to the shuttle service I was  told shuttle service was full. I asked how can that be I contacted you directly prior to booking and was told the service was available. The clerk explained that due to covid they are offering few rides with limited space. Then she proceeded to tell me the only thing I could do was come back in the morning and if there was a cancellation, I could then fill that spot. I looked her as calmly as I could and said I was very frustrated with this situation. I understand its nit your fault but I would be contacting management and proceeded to my room. 

I went up to room dropped off bags and tried to call down to guests services with no answer so went back downstairs to ask for sheets only to see the two guests that were right behind me at check in getting shuttle tickets. I then asked the guest as they were walking away if they got shuttle tickets and she said to me in a stunned manor uh for the :00.

I then went back upstairs to compose myself because I was to upset to question the front desk clerk in that moment. 

Upon returning my room I proceed to unfold then unfold the sleeper sofa to find no sheets, a band aid and a bed full of what appeared to be beach sand. 

I then go back downstairs to ask for sheets and after getting the sheets asked the clerk how the girls behind got shuttle service and was told oh someone cancelled the :00 (now remember the guests told me they got on the :00 shuttle). I bit my tongue and again walked back upstairs. 

I find it extremely unlikely that someone cancelled between the time I walked upstairs and back down when the guests were literally behind me! And the clerk would of had to stop checking the guests in, answer the phone and then continue checking them in and book their shortly and print their tickets (because she was the only one at the desk). Additionally, if it was the case that there by chance a cancellation in that short amount of time and the desk is booking shuttle on first come first serve basis (even though that was never communicated), I checked I prior to the guests behind me, expressed my need for the shuttle and therefore should have been offered the tickets first. 

At this point I was done for the evening. My husband decides to go downstairs to ask for an explanation. He is told the shuttles only take a few people because of covid. Which still is an unacceptable answer given complemtary service is advertised, confirmed and honored to other guests and the shuttle we took from the airport to the hotel that was offered by the hotel didnt have an empty seat on it to include the front passenger seat that did not have a seat belt available!!!! At this point my husband requests to speak to a manager. He is told there isnt one on duty but one would be in at :00 am. 

So then he decides to contact the  number to explain the situation and gets hung up on three times. Then when someone stays on the phone long enough to speak to he is told shuttle service isnt provided at this location. Which is simply not true as its on the website, I verbally confirmed it prior to booking and confirmed at check in. Once that was communicated the customer service rep informs my husbands twice hes documenting the call and then, big surprise, hangs up. 


Im addition, to the fold out bed situation, theres  a broken handle on the dresser and theres mold on the outlet. The reason I discovered that is because the chargers didnt work so we checked to ensure the table was plugged in and it wasnt. 

Im a very patient person but was upset when I learned that after doing my due diligence, paying more for this hotel over my other choices in the area because of the shuttle service I confirmed was in fact not available, I was pretty upset, but realistically looking at this as humans and given the issues the service industry is facing I would have moved on as this issue could be solved with  an Uber or taxi. However, after going back downstairs to learn the guest immediately behind me was treated differently, that made this situation unacceptable!  All services should either be available to all guests or no guests. You should never pick and choose which guests you would like to service and which you choose not to.

Texas A&M University Thank you for the quick response. We were told the manager wouldnt be in until  after they told us theyd be in at  and we had to order an Uber in order to make our pre scheduled cruise check in. Thank you Debbie",Guests at Comfort Inn Miami were told shuttle service was full when they checked in. The hotel has been accused of being too busy and not providing the promised services.,iââm going work getting stuck late checkin clerk,"Nope. Never again! Complaints headed to corporate since the desk clerks are not able to provide the promised and advertised services, the manager seems to be non existent (told there wasnt one last night but would be in at  am but of course when I went to the desk after not sleeping well due to the less than ideal check in experience, to no the manager is not here but will be inat ) and was hung up on four times when calling the -800"

"Thanks, but I literally just got thrown out of your Rice Lake Econolodge by the police thanks to your rude nasty third shift clerk. She started insulting and threatening me, and lied flat out to the police to get them to have me leave. At pm on NYE in below zero cold.  All because I was upset the hot tub wasn't working after I paid full price for a hotel with pool and hot tub.  Until she came in and started screaming, the second shift clerk and I were working it out.  I'm filing several complaints.  I got the impression she does this regularly. She was a huge rude bully.  I'm A middle aged disabled woman. This is appalling. Just an FYI, I was completely sober and just came here to swim with my grandson who lives nearby. I used to come here regularly for this purpose. At least they didn't call the cops on you for complaining about their false advertising. They three me out in sub zero weather at pm on NYE. Unreal. They threw me out too! A middle aged disabled woman! Because I complained that they were charging full price but not telling people amenities were broken! At pm on NYE in sub zero weather! Choice Hotels Hello, and thank you.  I just got home actually and saw this. I will message you all the details here. Let me gather the confirmation number from the email and I will get that message out. Thank you!  I just returned home and saw your message.  I arrived on Friday night a little after :30pm. Its a  mile drive in very cold weather and I had been looking forward to a nice swim and soak in the hot tub. I pay extra to stay at hotels with pools so my grandson can come and we can swim and relax.  After completing the check in, I noticed the pool area,was dark and asked wh Sorry, hit post by mistake.  I'll finish my post and repost! I asked why. There was no notice at the front desk nor on the website at booking that the pool or hot tub were down.  She stated the hot tub had been broken for several days and wasn't sure if/when it will be fixed. I expressed dismay as this was the third time over the holiday season that this had happened to me while checking into a hotel.  In the other cases, I was offered a room upgrade if I wanted, which I chose. I asked about this option here but the clerk wasn't sure this was something management would allow. I was contemplating my options, including going elsewhere but was concerned because any potential refund would take several business days to process.  The clerk and I were debating options when the third shift clerk, an older heavy set woman with longer grey hair came in about pm.  She sat down on the couches and started yelling rudely to me that if this was going to be a problem that I could take my money and get out. I asked her if she was a manager and she said no. I stated I didn't wish to interact with her as she was treating me rudely.  This got her very upset and she stormed over stating she was calling the cops to have me thrown out. I'm a middle aged disabled woman, who was a threat to no one. She just completely flipped out. She lied on the phone to police and made it seem like I was a danger, so they sent two squad cars and four officers came in, two of whom were extremely aggressive really with me. I was insulted and put down, then forced to leave.  I had to find a last minute place to go on NYE at pm for the remainder of my stay. Needless to say I ended up having to pay much more for the same stay booking this late at another place on a holiday weekend.  Reading reviews on trip advisor you can see several negative reviews regarding rude staff, including a previous review where others were also threatened with ""take your money and get out"".  The clerk at the Micro tel where I ended up says a lot of people have stated to her this is a problem with that kind of treatment at Rice Lake Econolodge.  This was an extremely traumatic experience for me.  I had just gotten off the road and was looking forward to a nice relaxing weekend.  The second shift clerk did state she had told management this had been an issue with people, and indicated that fell on deaf ears. I honestly can't believe that this rude and unbalanced woman on the third shift has been able to continue working here so long. Some of the complaints go back a few years. It was double digits below zero when they threw me out. Not including a bitterly cold windchill. Someone like this has no business working with the public, much less at any place that values their reputation. Both she and the officers refused to give me her name, but she worked third shift NYE.

Email is  and mailing address is P.O.Box , Butternut, WI .  Thank you. Hey, you didn't say if I accepted the points that the case is closed when you offered them. What happened to me was a very serious offence against a person with disabilities. I don't want this case closed, I want the employee who behaved in this manner to be held accountable. I would have refused the points had you said upfront that  this will mean the case is closed. I do not wish for my case to be closed without resolution! You did NOT rectify the situation! I told you my PO box because the mail won't come to my home address as I had to switch to a PO box because of the snowplow. This is quickly turning into another situation of poor customer service! Thank you. I just wish to continue to be able to check the progress on this case as I am concerned that local management will do nothing, in which case I would wish to escalate this issue to corporate.  They have an employee who is abusive to people.  Nothing will change as long as they continue to employ her.  I'm concerned nothing further will be done. I appreciate your honesty, its just frustrating that potentially nothing could be done. The local talk in Rice Lake is that place has had long term problems that management turns a blind eye to.  It's concerning that choice hotels doesn't seem more concerned about this overall. Thank you. I do appreciate that. It was just a difficult experience, and unpleasant way to start a new year.  I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else.","'I paid full price for a hotel with pool and hot tub.

https://Attention Debbie Our daughter has Autism. She wears pull ups.  She leaked through her pull up.  We even had a note requesting a first floor room because she is scared of elevators.  They said they didnt have any rooms available on the first floor so we took the stairs.  The room was not clean and sanitary when we got there but we didnt complain because there is usually no point. 
I literally took the bedding off the bed so the hotel staff wouldnt have to - 
I have many people telling me to get an Autism Advocacy Group and the News involved.  I am considering getting an attorney.  I have also been told that they are not able to charge the $300 because they never notified us of it and didnt inform us of it ahead of time either. 
This has happened before at a hotel and they literally sent staff with new bedding and a snack for our little girl. We were treated with kindness at another hotel. 
This hotel is NOT one I would want representing my brand - you can even look and see other complaints and some pretty serious ones on the FB page of the hotel location itself.

Please let me know if I need to contact my attorney and the local area news. I am going to speak with my lawyer about this - I have been advised hat the $300 charge is illegal because it was a separate charge and we did not authorize it.

"Stayed at Comfort Inn in Rivergate, Madison, and the woman (Samantha?) at the front desk thought it was wise to follow my boyfriend and I out while filming us with her phone as we were loading our trunk. When she was noticed, she runs back behind a door, resfuses to let me in, and accuses us of stealing a TV. She filmed me the entire interaction, and made me feel pretty low after not letting me show her I CLEARLY DIDNT STEAL A DAMN TV. The manager Amanda today apparently thought that was the right action, and treated me just as a thief over the phone even though it was clear I wasnt. This is usually where I make a funny joke to dog on your business, but Ive honestly been treated terribly for no reason and did nothing wrong. Its sad how the business was ran. Never had this experience in my life actually.
Really enjoyed the room though! I wouldve came back just to use the hot tub... A shame. 
Comfort Inn condones their employees unprofessional and antagonizing behavior. Boooo. This is the first message I got. Heard back from what? If somebody tried to contact me I did not receive a message. Apologies! Ive searched and I cannot find the notification. I already called and made a formal complaint and the manager was nasty. I dont know where there is to go from there but heres a photo of the info.

Honestly just you responding is nice after my recent experience. Thank you. I carried out a couple lights in a bag. She was suspicious, but there were a lot of other ways to approach the situation that didnt involve filling and locking me out and did involve treating me like a normal person that spent money and cleaned up before I left.

Thank you again. Involve filming* The last name is Casler.

I called management yesterday morning and got so much of a rude treatment that I thought it was the same woman recording me from the night before. At first I wanted a refund, but I think I just wanted some kind of acknowledgment from the company this was not acceptable behavior. Thank you for your response and decency. Hi there! I would love to take you up on the free night stay and appreciate the response more than I can say! Here is the information you requested:

"Choice Hotels That's all you do is refer us back to the actual hotel, even though your company oversees all of your hotels.  Comfort Suites in Redmond, Oregon, won't return ANY of our phone calls.  Yes, it was also a non-cancelable reservation, unbeknownst to us, but we can't even get the manager to call us back.  Why are you attaching your name to hotels with such poor customer service?  Won't be returning to your hotels. Anila Wilds Yep, they DON'T CARE!  Unforeseen snowstorm so can't make it to Central Oregon and, nope, still going to keep all our money.  Can't even get the manager to return a phone call.  Shady, shady company. Nothing has been resolved.  Your manager at Comfort Suites Redmond Airport will not return a phone call.  We have stayed there MANY times and have never had an issue, but to not be compensated at all when an uncharacteristic snowstorm prevents us from traveling is ridiculous.  You put people's lives in danger, braving the weather, so they don't lose their money.  What if we would have come down with Covid?  Should we have come to your hotel so we don't lose our money? My name is not Sasha and your company has NOT been helpful at all.  All of your comments I receive are from bots.  You can easily look up my reservation and get my contact info to call me if you were actually serious about resolving this.  Your company does not care so stop wasting my time.  When my phone rings from your company, then I will take you seriously.  Until then, I will be doing all that I can to get the word out about your company and your unprofessional business practices. Re: Confirmation #57064166 I was wondering if there is any way to get a refund for hotel stay we weren't able to make due to an unusual December snowstorm in Portland, Oregon. We have stayed at Comfort Suites Redmond Airport several times before when spending the holidays with family in Redmond, but were unable to make it through any of the mountain passes to spend Christmas with family. When calling, front desk informed me that our reservation stated 'no refunds,' but was inquiring to see if there was a way to get even a partial refund. Obviously, we would have rather have been in Redmond with family, but we just couldn't safely make it We cancelled our reservation, due to an unforeseen snowstorm that made us unable to get over Mount Hood to get to Redmond from Portland.  We were to check in /30 and return on /2.  The name is either under Julie Ellis or Jason Ellis. Thank you so much!  Mailing address is:  Boynton Street Oregon City, OR .

"I paid for a  day stay at the Econo Lodge and checked in everything was fine the very next morning l gotta call from the manager saying they're refusing my service because we had a dog and l informed them he was my ESA dog plus they're website says Pet Friendly so they kicked us out and said they would give us a refund for the remaining days we aren't staying they left us out in the streets with our money and till this day  months later l still have not received a refund from them nor my remaining money for house keeping fee for each day  Good afternoon no it hasn't gotten resolved yet l just hadn't had time to give you guys full details with screenshots of emails,phone calls and reservations for that day yet until this weekend since I work  full time jobs Monday-Friday Mel Barron I don't know if it's just the hotel verses Choice Hotels but if they're gonna have disrespectful crappy hotels who is just scamming people for they're money but it's been  going on  months now that l gotten any refund back and they lied to my bank and said l stayed there for a full  days when l didn't so we're going threw a dispute at the moment and I will take them to court. 
Choice Hotels I'm inboxing you guys now with screenshots shots of proof of stay and all my facts. Kimberly Davis I paid for a  day room got kicked out the next morning because they said l had a dog even though they're website says PET FRIENDLY and was told they'll give me a refund for the remaining  days and here l am  months later l still haven't got a refund and they also charged me for  days of house cleaning on top of that When I stayed there l decided to go threw a different website this time which was Travelure we booked it for  days and got kicked out the next morning because we had a dog which is my ESA because he used to belong to my mom before she passed away. We booked a room at the Econo Lodge in El Cajon city they called me the next morning and kicked us out and said they're refusing our service while we was still at work we had to get off work early an upon arrival they locked us out of our room and turned the room keys off so we had to asked them to open our room to get our belongings prior to that we've stayed there under Benjamin Walker threw your website for  days with no issues with our dog being there with my ESA letter for my dog but because of this bad experience my husband  and I stopped using your website because of this experience threw had to go threw until this day  months later they still haven't refunded me they lied to my bank and said we stayed there for the whole entire  days when we only was allowed to stay there for  night. Not Motel  but the Econo Lodge in El Cajon city Choice Hotels it wasn't Motel  it was the Econo Lodge Kimberly Davis yesss... I have to go threw all my emails again l will be able to do it this weekend Hi Choice here's my proof of when l rented the hotel stay but was only allowed to stay there for  night and got kicked out the very next morning and till this day they never gave me a refund And website says Pet Friendly I I checked in turned in my ESA letter for my dog, stayed the night and recieved a phone call the next morning that l was being kicked out and they was refusing my service and was told they would give me the remaining refund for the days l didn't stay and the house keeping fee back for the remaining days l didn't stay which was $10 a day back but never got my refund back till this day And pior to that my husband and I stayed there for  weeks with our dog with no issues and turning in his ESA certified letter to them so we don't think it would be a big deal staying there again with our dog I'm homeless at the moment and Encno Lodge kicked us out in the streets with no place to go and no refund Choice Hotels please check your inbox for updates with proof Thank you Fernando but we stayed there for  night and got kicked out the next morning also l paid for my house cleaning fee threw my bank card not the rd party do you know if they ever reimbursed me for the house cleaning fee as well? Also when I'm looking for hotels to stay l always type in pet friendly hotels and Encno Lodge in El Cajon pops up and yes can you please send me a confirmation receipt please and thank you so much for helping me. I almost forgot to leave my email it's 
The rd party never gave me a refund but gave me a hard time about Encno Lodge not giving them my refund...  This explains everything thanks Also Fernando we stayed they're prior threw your company website Choice Hotel under Benjamin Walker with our dog and had we know it wasn't pet friendly we wouldn't had went back we even turned in our dog ESA letter to the front desk and we had no issues with being there. And question #2 can they charge me for  days when we only was able to spend  night there we would have left before check out time had we known they were kicking us out  since we was planning to stay a full  days so can they charge me for staying  days when we didn't get to stay for  days? Or can they charge me for  days if they didn't inform me we had to leave until after check out time? Thank you Numas can you please kindly ask them did they ever give me a refund for housekeeping as well. Can you please also send me proof of refund to the rd party since they never gave me a refund please Thank you.... Choice Hotels thanks Choice for resolving my issue however Econo Lodge is wrong for charging me a extra day for kicking me out of my room without a head notice and charging me for after check out time. Choice Hotel.... I have  more question My question is: Should l be charged to stay any days for my hotel stay that l wasn't allowed to stay when my husband and I stayed there for  days prior to this incident under your website since he sighed up as a member and we reported our dog being there at the hotel with us and turned in all of his documents to the front office wouldn't it be they're fault they didn't inform us that there's no dog allowed at that hotel? Because had they told us or we would have known we would of nevered rebooked there again out of respect for the rules, but they let us stay for  days with the dog with no warning. Shouldn't they be responsible for kicking us out and not charge us because of them failing to do they're job properly? 

If you look under my husband Benjamin Walker you'll see we actually stayed at this hotel for  days prior to renting the room again but this time under my name These are the  days we stayed with our dog So since nobody gave us any kind of warning that dogs aren't allowed we wouldn't had booked again. And you see l booked our room after the stay from above. Shouldn't they give me a full refund in all fairness? Choice Hotels please check your inbox again please Thank you l just wanted them to know what they did to me was wrong Here's my husband info Thank you You wouldn't have to have the phone number to Travelure do you? I need to talk to them about the refund they received from the hotel that they never refunded me and they're phone number isn't on Google it just has email only my bank can't even locate they're phone number if it's not to much to ask. Thanks Debbie Do you guys out beat your competitors prices if we find a lower rate eles where? We have but honestly when we do Priceline is always lower then Choice so that's  of the reasons why we stopped using Choice",Kimberly Davis paid for a day room at the Econo Lodge in El Cajon city and checked in everything was fine the very next morning l gotta call from the manager saying they're refusing our service because we had a dog.

"Your hotel in NYC ""The Paul"" is unsafe, dirty, with no workers. I have been trying to report this for three months. Its clear you have no interest in your customers or integrity in the properties you run. No it wasnt resolved. Paul Hotel,   W th St, New York, NY  Novemeber th check in  Elyse Graziano Case ID #  This hotel stay and dealing with your customer service has been one of the worst experiences in my life Its shocking you operate your business the way you do The issue is, ,000 isnt even enough to book one night at one of your properties using points. So while it may take $1,600 to earn that amount, it is in no way equal to that value. On top of this I have spent months trying to get a response from the Paul hotel to address the issue. Your representatives clearly are unable to contact the hotel management because I have yet to hear back. Which is conclusive to the issue during my stay that no one in fact works there or mans the desk. Extremely dangerous and unprofessional. I never agreed to ,000 points, the representative I spoke to just applied them to my account after hearing my complaint. So please stop acting like I accepted that as a final compensation because it is no where NEAR sufficient. I want to be contacted or connected to someone at corporate Choice Hotels to discuss this further as I have never been allowed to speak to someone besides you toll free line , which I have been met with rude representatives each time. I will be reporting you to be better business bureau, I see choice hotels already has  complaints through them. Which makes sense because your company is running dirty unsafe hotels without a care in the world for customers. So my question is- who can I speak with to formally solve this issue? Id prefer email. Thanks I have already tried to contact  multiple times and there is no response. So being that your choice in using ""franchise"" system to relieve you of any accountability, I'm sure you will say there is nothing you can do there either. You are correct that ,000 points were offered, via email and then when I responded another agent told me I was forbidden to recieve ANY further points past the ,000 and couldnt recieve ,000 more points. So which is it? Why are your representitives reporting different allowances/protocal? I will happily forward you the correspondence so you can view just how disorganized your customer service desk is. Please show me where I can book TWO free nights for ,000 points via a link to the exact options. As I havent been able to locate anything of the sort. I do not find your resolution acceptable, perhaps I would have had I not been met with rude customer service agents who have treated me with disdain and disregard. However I will not accept anything less than ,000 points. I will speak to someone else if you are unable to help/choose not to. As I've stated I will be reporting my experience to the Better Business Bureau as this is simply not the way a business should be operating. This was over a .00 cost to stay at your hotel ..So not sure where you came up with offering the .00 USD. I would like for you to apply ,000 points to my account so that the balance is ,000. And then I will accept the .00 USD and we can move on from this. Let me know the details needed to process this. Thanks Okay, just to end this whole ordeal I will take $100.00 USD by mail.

 /27/22 Thursday 
Left the room about :35 pm 
Returned about pm 
During that time someone entered the room and took my 
Klean Kanteen thermos out of my backpack. 
 /28/22 Friday About  AM I checked my backpack for the thermos to fill with coffee. It was not in there. 
This made me search for the sun glasses.  Which I discovered were also not in the room About :45 Fri I went to the front desk and ask the person staff in the desk to check the video to see who entered my room on Thursday evening. At that time he told me he cannot do it
The manager would be in about  minutes which would be about :05 AM And would help me 

About :10 AM I returned to the front desk to talk to the manager. The same person at the front desk Shrugged his shoulders and said the manager would be in in a bout  minutes. 
I asked him to review the video from the hallway security camera  he looked at me with a face indicating  he was not going to do it and it wouldn't be done.  
About :45 AM I went to the front desk to see the manager the person at the front desk looked at me as indicating that the manager was  in and would not be coming in. 
Obviously he lied to me. About the manager coming in. 
The expression on his face indicated to me  
I was not going to get help. I return to my room to 
call Quality and Customer Service. 
Explain to them that which  transpired. 
I also told the customer service rep that I had intended to extend my stay several days. I was not going to do that if I didn't feel a place. 
They told me they would send the franchise owner/hotel owner a message. 
They told me also to check out which I did. As I was scheduled to check out. 
Then to call them back. 

I did as I was told by Quality Customer service to check out at the appropriate time before  AM. I called Customer Service back. They told me that they had not received any response from the owner of the property. 
Quality and Customer Service told me to check back in another hour with Quality Inn Customer Service. As they were going to send the hotel owner another message.   
I did that about two hours later. They said that the hotel owner has not responded. And then I should wait  hours to Saturday the th.
 /29/22 Saturday Late morning
 I called Quality and Customer Service. They told me they have not heard anything from the hotel owner and that they would do a follow up and contact me. I'm not receive any kind of contact. The hotel owner has not contacted me.  

Friday front desk person  indicated I was not gonna get my  thermos and  sunglasses back.  

My perception is they intended to steal my stuff and they do not care about customers they do not care about long-term customers.

In the past three years I have stayed at a quality inn six times.
For at least   nights. 

However this hotel never asked for my choice privileges number to give me credit for the nights  I have stayed there. 
    

Please send me your contact phone number. Facebook referal Messages waste time 
We need to talk on the phone I did send email /31/2022 as of 
Today Tuesday /1/22 :46 am I have not Acknowledgment to my email. 

The simple expectations.
 a Safe place  to stay where one can trust they are safe. 
Not at Quality Inn downtown Salt Lake City Lake city. 
This place has been going downhill for the last year. 
The past couple of months it's gone downhill more. The hallways dingy aroma  even though they look clean on the surface.

There is also many people like me. I made a post across several social media (On Facebook search for ""Overheard In Kalkaska"" and Rodeway Inns page) and more than  people have came forward with medical records to back up their claims of bed bugs, mites, termites, scabies, pinworm and threadworm. They have rented rooms KNOWING they are infested. They have chosen money over childrens health. They say my children made the stain yet if children made the stain with chocolate milk the WHITE sheet above the mattress would be stained... Yet its not. They claim Orkim is in once a month...

When we inquired about the door not closing they said all their doors do that when there is a temp change  it was just a horrible experience.

Hotel said credit card was declined so they sold the  rooms we had reservations for. Which was not correct. Thank you for getting back with me. I do appreciate the quick response, however the headache caused by this experience is much greater. Imagine flying into a city for vacation only to find out  you have to spend  hours (4 people,  hours each) looking for a place to stay because the hotel chain you know and love have disregarded you and your party like a piece of trash.  We ended up staying at Marriott properties and were greeted with open arms.  I would expect a little more compensation than  free night when we were planning staying a total of  nights. The amount we had to pay was much higher than we anticipated. It cost us almost double because of last minute reservations. The matter is not resolved. I am still furious.  What good is it to hold with a credit card if it truly is not ""held"". I would like to know how that hotel and employee is going to be held accountable.  This incident affected our entire trip. I would like for you to put yourself in our shoes at  AM Saturday morning and let me know how you would feel! Your phone team was absolutely no use.

I understand that but when I googled it said a hot breakfast was included. A cold sandwich does not constitute charging $108. We had to go buy a hot breakfast which was an additional $27.00.

"I'm so disgusted with the stays at various locations of choice hotels and the different incidental amounts. 
I've had various problems out of everyone I've stayed at.  Was charged a .00 incidentals charge tonite, and in past stays its just been .00
I'm sorry but  .00 is extremely out of proportion. My wife wasn't happy about this either and was blowing her top. I'm very upset about all of this. Yes I understand that. I refused the .00 incidentals fee and asked for a refund.  But in the past I've only paid .00 for incidentals.  This needs to be  posted at the front desk and online if this process is gonna be a sop. This location here-Sleep inn & suites  Washington Blvd, Laurel, MD 

Needs some improvements. 
I'm gonna include pics: Snowy TV and if this is cable it should not be this way, but looking at the cable coming out of wall this could be an issue.
 nd was a busted shower head, was unable to take a shower. Water went everywhere as you can see in video.
 rd was a dirty mattress cover, possibly from bed bugs?? 
I did check for bedbugs but didn't see any or I would have really raised Cain and I'd have left!

These establishments really need some overseeing to see that these issues are addressed and fixed. 

Maybe the company CEO needs to go undercover   and check things out for themselves. March ,  arrival-  March ,  depart

For starters I checked in and went to my room and noticed when I first walked in the restroom that my toilet still actually had some dried feces on it that wasnt cleaned good at all. Next after going to bed I woke up in the middle of the night and was itching so some type bugs had been biting me and it didnt help that I went into the bathroom and saw a couple of bugs crawling around. Also after waking up the next morning from barely sleeping due to getting hit and constantly hearing tenants above me awake all night I actually noticed a few different strands of hair over my comforter set that was no where near my hair type so I was totally disgusted by this time with my stay at your hotel.

"I will also never stay at a choice hotel again.  I was on my way to Clearwater beach Florida to stay but my flight got cancelled with no other flights going out that day.

I  called customer service and they said they would talk to the hotel and try to get me a refund but they never called me back.  I emailed them without response.

"Choice Hotels so you say after the promotion is over. Had you provided the details clearly perhaps folks like myself would come back. Now you start your spring  separate nights for ,000 points. People would have been making a bigger effort to stay knowing that was actually going from Jan as well. Sad your chain is losing great customers. Guess your busy enough we don't concern you. ,000 points is rarely enough to stay in any Comfort Inn. Most of your other properties are so nasty I wouldn't choose them even for free. And most of the Comfort are ,000 to ,000 points per night. You need to add cost of Covid inflated room rates to your program. Choice Hotels yes I know all this information. And yet when your group advertise these reward programs you use the data of  locations as of that were the ones you could stay for free. All your low budget locations I have been by or stayed at are or are becoming so disgusting I would not stay at any of them. What happened to your group quality. Where did this become allowable in a group who's name ate Comfort, Quality etc....
Now I have in the past stayed at some nice locations and got to know the staff well too. However as I stated previously now the rates are so high I can stay at better,  cleaner Hotels of other brands cheaper that yours. I and a Diamond member in both Hilton and Wyndham. Was with your group and how quickly that got lowered..",Choice Hotels is losing great customers. I wouldn't choose them even for free. You need to add cost of Covid inflated room rates to your program.,youll stay at choice hotels if you give info post promotion,"Choice Hotels so you say after the promotion is over. Had you provided the details clearly perhaps folks like myself would come back. Now you start your spring  separate nights for,000 points. People would have been making a bigger effort to stay knowing that was actually going from Jan as well. Sad your chain is losing great customers. Guess your busy enough we don't concern you. {000 points is rarely enough to stay in any Comfort Inn. Most of your other properties are so"
"Tried to stay at the Sleep Inn in Savannah Ga on Abercorn street this past weekend. Absolutely awful. As soon as I walked there was dirt and grim on the walls behind the desk. Got to our room and it was already used, snuff on the counter and snacks on the bed in the room. Told the hostess, got us a different room and it also wasnt clean. Dust on everything, food pieces on the carpet, just gross. Along with that, there was a dog in the room beside us just barking and going absolutely ballistic the entire time we were there and no one was doing anything about it. Hallway was warm, grimy and stunk. Everything looked and smelled horrible. Canceled the reservation and left immediately after that because there was no way we were staying there. Even though Im a choice reward member with a lot of points, they would not refund me for that night, only the next two (booked for three total), even thought I was there for maybe less then  minutes just getting everything figured out and never slept in the room. Even if they technically had to clean it again because I walked in there, it needed cleaned as soon as I unlocked the door? Extremely upset and will never stay at a choice hotel again. Had a bad experience at another choice hotel in Gettysburg PA and management never seems to want to fix it or remedy things for a loyal member. Disgusted.

Fairmont wv  These are the specific details for the stay I had a large issue with at the comfort suites Im Gettysburg I stayed at this hotel for multiple weeks. There was never a discount for extended stays or healthcare workers. There was an old lady who worked the desk during the day who was usually very rude. I called before I even booked this specific stay and asked if they offered a half day rate because I needed to check out past check out time that specific day but didnt want to stay another might. She said multiple times I could get a half day rate for not staying the entire night and to let her know the day of. I did in fact let her know the day of and then she said it couldnt be done anymore because the hotel was at a high capacity and Id have to pay for another night in full if I wanted a late check out. I told her that I stay there  nights every week and was going to continue to stay there  nights every week for  weeks because Im a travel nurse in the area and asked if she could give it to me at a half day rate like she said. She was extremely rude and said that she called management and they also said no. That was the last night I stayed there and will ever stay there. I dont understand why she or management would prioritise keeping a room open instead of accommodating a loyal member and customer. That business ideal doesnt make sense to me. Prior to that I also had issues such as: multiple dead and alive stink bugs on the floor/ bed/ carpet, moldy bathroom, bathroom water that took  minutes to get hot, microwave with old food covering it, stained sheets and couch, and leftover food on the carpet (this stuff occurred every week with every room, not just once). When I asked if someone could come up and vacuum, the housekeeper came to the room and gave my boyfriend the vacuum to do it himself. Also had someone playing loud music one night and told the nightshift desk lady about it and she said she would look into it but the music never stopped and I had to go into work early in the morning, I was always there for work, never for leisure. I was going to look past those issues because the hotel was very close to work but after being spoken to rudely by staff I went to a holiday inn express for the remainder of my nights in town. Yes I would also like to accept the ,000 points for Gettysburg as well, thank you Thank you!","Tried to stay at the Sleep Inn in Savannah Ga on Abercorn street this past weekend.

"Do you own the quality inn in mayport Atlantic Beach? It's approximately :30 a.m. and your desk clerk on site refuses to help me log on to the internet and says that he's going to call the police because I hung up the phone on him. Teach your personnel how to help guests log on to the internet and not to become defensive and argumentative because they do not know how and then threatened to call the police and kick me out of the hotel who holds the license for the Quality Inn on Mayport Rd., Atlantic Beach Fl? Hello Debbie could we do this by email .  
The details of this event are quite horrific. I emailed a full explanation to a Mr. Kai Patel on Monday who I was told is the manager of this property on Mayport Road in Atlantic Beach. I have not heard back from him. I have also requested a  tape of the call I presume Justin made because I believe he made false allegations to manipulate the police to respond.  It is a crime to lie to the police to get them to initiate an investigation for the purpose of harassing someone.  The three officers who came to my room were very polite and courteous. I'm sure they were as astounded as I was as to why they were there.
When I finally checked out, Justin was laughing and joking that he had gotten the police to pay me a visit... he told me to go back to Baltimore and that I was never to come to that hotel again or as he put it ""his"" hotel. His behavior was a agitated, aggressive and alarming. I'm a  year old woman. I've been to that hotel on two prior occasions with absolutely no problems from other staff and I had a pleasant experience upon check-in the day before with a clerk named Morgan.
Please continue this conversation with the appropriate people via email. thank you Are you planning on responding to my inquiry about the conduct of your employee Justin at the Quality Inn in Atlantic Beach Florida? I will do that.  I am waiting for the Atlantic Beach police tape of the phone call from your employee Justin at the Quality Inn in Atlantic Beach.  I intend to use this phone call to file criminal charges against this employee  who made false statements to the police to enlist them to harass me during my stay at your hotel.  They came too my hotel rom, spoke to me briefly and then left.  Hours later when I checked out Justin laughed and said if I every came there again he'd call the police and have them ""talk to me.""  He was agitated and aggressive.  His supervisor a Mr. Patel, he not bothered to respond to my emails.  I have also told my credit card company to open a dispute since you are the only one who has bothered to respond to my complaints about this disrespectful and dangerous employee.  Denise B I told you before... I'm waiting to get the police tape of the call Justin made... it is a crime to make false allegations to the police to use them to harass someone without a credible Foundation. You'll hear from me when I get the tape I intend to seek a criminal complaint against Justin for harassing me by calling the police Please advise if the Quality Inn in Atlantic Beach is a franchisee owned property licensed by Choice..please also advise if you provide any management services or oversight. As I wait to obtain the following three pieces of information from the Atlantic Beach Police Department ( CAD report/ body cam footage/ police call tape) regarding their response that morning to the hotel... I was informed by them that that property is a ""hotbed of drug activity"" and they are ""frequently called there"".
That is important information that the public deserves to know..I wish I'd known that.  I will be posting on relevant travel sites accordingly.",Debbie could we do this by email? Could we do this by email?,youll use phone call police tell hotel owner,"Do you own the quality inn in mayport Atlantic Beach?

"Yesterday I stayed at the Comfort Suites on Peoria in Denver, Colorado. I had the worst experience I have ever had at a Choice Hotel or any hotel really. I checked into the room March th @ around :30 am. When I got into the room I noticed my phone in the room did not work. I went back to the front desk to tell her that and she said she would have the maintenance guy fix it and he would be there in  minutes to fix it. Well, he never came. Check out time came around and the front desk said they were calling the room for me to check out but I had already told them my phone didn't work and it never got fixed even after my complaint. She came to my room being very rude. I asked for a  PM checkout like the Choice Hotel members were allowed to and she denied my request very rudely. When she came into the room to wake me up, she came very rudely. She was saying very rude things to me and made me leave the room door open while I cleaned the room. I told her I was naked and asked if she could close the door while I got dressed and she laughed and told me no. I finally got dressed and while I was getting the last of my things, she came in calling the police on me. I told her I was almost done and she said I dont care youre going to jail.I started crying because she was being very rude and she told me she doesnt care about me crying. I told her I felt like I was in jail with how rudely she was treating me and she said that's where I was going anyway. I have never had an experience so bad in my life. I felt like I wasn't a paying customer at a hotel. Is there any way I can get a free night at a hotel due to the HORRIBLE experience I have had with one of your hotels tonight?

The couch has a stain on one cushion that looks like a skid mark (too gross to say what it actually looked like), the microwave was dirty, the floor in front of the sink was sticky, there was only  roll of toilet paper and no bath towels (I had to go to the front office to get some. Attendant got the items without an attitude but she never said anything. She didn't even apologize). To top it off, my husband and I were questioning if the sheets had even been changed.

"Good morning,

I need a number to the corporate office/franchise owner (Veer Vora) to obtain the information needed to purse legal charges against the hotel Comfort Suites Airport- in Newport News Va for discrimination and tampering with credit card/receipt documents. John Clark left instructions to illegally evict my family into the streets as a result we were forced to stay in our vehicle until other arrangements could be made with  children. We called the NN police department out to the hotel on Sunday /3/22  to ensure our safety as we prepared to leave. The embarrassment we encountered in front of our grandchildren, other guest and hotel staff was unethical and beyond regular resolve. This experience has left my family emotionally scared as we were given less than  minutes to vacate the property after being their over  days. We were treated less than human and will take the necessary steps to ensure this never happens again to another African American family. Covid-19 reshaped the way that people travel and being abruptly put in the street during a World wide pandemic was detrimental to our safety!
We have live video footage, pictures of the room, phone records and detailed bank statements documenting when the harassment began! It is imperative that I hear back from the owner. My family does not feel safe communicating further with John Clark out of fear of retaliation. We are not comfortable that he will not further abuse his power by calling other choice hotels with false information after receiving an email from him on /4/22 stating we were banned from staying at the property in the future.

" we need to talk Good evening Im reaching out in regards to a horrible reservation I experienced at one of you hotels. confirmation number-  Name on reservation- Rahkim Summers Arrival date- Thursday March st 

Hotel address-4716 new bern avenue Hope to hear back in the morning about this matter Good morning, yea Id like to voice the biggest of complaints. About this hotel and I used that word very vaguely. Because staying there it felt very little like a hotel and more like I was renting a room at an apartment building. This building had people who had been obviously basically living out of there. Roaming the hall, getting arrested.  Smoking, playing loud music at all times and  even offering  me drugs. Upon arrival I was not aware of this, seeing as though I had arrive late on a Thursday night and was staying in town until that following Monday. I was hoping to have a peaceful vacation away. But this was the complete opposite. The sink in my room had a leak, To which someone from the staff had placed a trash can under it, I didnt notice until said trash can was overflowing with water. Part of the carpet in my room  was coming up from the floor. And the icing on the cake was without any notification on Saturday the water in the hotel had been cut off completely after the room next to mine appeared to have some sort of leak which caused my room floor to get wet. 

I thought I was choosing a well enough hotel to not be met with so many problems  let alone the magnitude of the problems. If I had the opportunity I wouldve immediately left and went to another hotel the next day. However my allotted money to stay somewhere had already been charged to my card from this residence. For the rest of the weekend I didnt even stay at this hotel. I simple houses my items there and went back and forth to get them. I notified management of my complaints and disdain and even asked if I could receive some sort or refund to which I was told Id have to talk to booking or to customer service for the hotel   I am highly and I mean HIGHLY disappointed with this Hotel and personally dont think it should be running if these are the standards it keeps.

more than I was before.

I tried to get a ground floor room at  other hotels when I  could not get one at Rodeway Inn. One was over $400. and the other had given the last ground floor room to the man standing in line in front of my husband.

"Hi! I finally got around to making an account. My account number is MXS768530. Phone number is -822-3906. Email is  Home address is  old post rd, worthington, MA  thank you See directly above please Im confused why you need a different phone number. Here are the initial details I had sent. I have no idea what more information you could need. Is there something specific you need? I only have my cell phone, no landline. Hi,
The hotel confirmation is . It was the Econo Lodge at  Canal St. Brattleboro VT . My name is Mikaela Spence. Date of stay was /20/21 to /22/21. It was booked through Bring Fido. There was a clear cancellation policy listed that if we needed to cancel after the deadline we still had to pay for the first night. After pulling into the driveway and seeing people sitting in the parking lot drinking in hotel chairs in parking spaces, we decided it was time to cancel. The front desk staff would not allow this and we couldnt afford to pay for a second hotel so we stayed.   There were no pillows in the room and it didnt look cleaned. There was hospital discharge paperwork on the desk from someone who apparently lived there and listed the hotel as his home address. He also apparently stole the batteries to the smoke detector when he left, which were not replaced. The second night we were there we were told not to leave our room because someone beat up their girlfriend really badly and they didnt want our daughter to see it. The police were interviewing them for a while. There were roaches in the hallway (luckily we didnt see any in our room). All in all it was a horrible experience. If they had refunded us even a portion of the stay I would h e considered using a different Econo Lodge in the future but this was horrible. Here was the initial reply from choice hotels: It is disappointing that your stay was not up to the level of quality you have come to expect from our hotels, Mikaela. With your feedback, our field staff teams will be taking the appropriate measures to ensure this hotel continues to operate under the expected terms of its franchise agreement to avoid this from happening again. As it turns out, as a franchisor, our limited access to the hotels' billing system prevents us from refunding our guests' Credit Cards, so we cannot offer you a refund. Nonetheless, we sincerely hope you can consider giving us another opportunity to serve you better and show you the great experience you can have with us by offering you ,000 points as compensation. You will be able to book a free night at over ,500 hotels with these points. Kindly know that reward nights are available from ,000 to ,000 points, depending on the hotel's location, season, or arrival day. Please reply with your member number, phone number, email, and mailing address to credit your points. If you are not a member yet, we can help you open a new account with the same information requested. Hope to hear more from you. -Jendy Hi, the points sound good.

I called the front desk asking them to come bring one and was told that since housekeeping was gone I would have to wait until they were back in the morning. I asked if they could look for a curtain or move me to a different room and they said they would look for a curtain. I never heard back Then in the morning I called and they said they would bring me one in  minutes. An hour went by and I called again and they finally brought one.

"Comfort Inn and Suites

We are season pass holders for Six Flags Over Georgia and we visit as often as we can. We have stayed at Comfort Inn and Suites the past few times we have came and it was just okay. Not bad enough to complain about, but bad enough to say we wouldn't stay there next time.

Well, today was next time and my dear husband forgot that we said we wouldn't be back and went ahead and rebooked for our spring break visit. 

We spent the morning/afternoon and left early, thinking we would relax at our hotel and then go out to dinner and return to the park and visit the aquarium the next day. When we got to our room on the th floor, we immediately noticed the smell. It was like wet dog that had been covered with perfume and cleaning products. Not pleasant. We walked in the room and immediately noticed stains on the couch and chair. Stains on the sheets, what looked like pieces of the popcorn ceiling all over the bed, duct tape on the floor, and a sticky substance on the nightstand. That was plenty for me.

We stayed for about an hour debating what to do and ultimately decided to go to the front desk and ask for a different room. In the time we were there, myself and my  year old started having major allergy flare-ups. Coughing, itchy eyes, runny nose. My husband went to the front desk and they told him that there were no other rooms for us.

He then asked them to refund us and would find somewhere else to stay. They refunded, took our key cards, then told us it would take about  weeks for our refund to appear in our bank account. So now we're out $200 of what we had saved for our trip, and have no hotel room.

As we were gathering our things from the room we noticed a HUGE corner full of black mold in the room. I mean, huge. No wonder we couldn't stop coughing. When the manager to came to check the room, she seemed shocked at the mold and said she had no idea.

They had a smaller room (2 queens) that she could give us for a discounted rate.  We are a family of . No way we're fitting into that room to begin with, but then we'd be out even more money. Heck no, we were not paying them for THEIR poor business. 

So now, we are driving back home (4 hours away) with four disappointed kids and two very angry parents.

Will NEVER stay here again, and unless you enjoy paying for filth and mold, I'd advise you not to either. Lithia springs, Ga Thank you for the response. We booked through Hotels.com so the confirmation number we have would not work to submit this feedback on your website. Even though we didn't book through you, I thought you should know since it's one of your hotels.  W. Pointe Ct. Lithia Springs, GA

She was mad that I stated I had pictures but was not listening to my statement on if housekeeping came I have pictures after the guys came back that I can show what was asked for was not done, and if she could come back to clean the problem can be fixed, was told she does not have room to move them around and that she is done with the conversation. From that I can tell she does not care about the establishment and that franchise agreement which I mentioned. The pictures online is not what is presented on arrival.

"We only stay in choice hotels and they got me bunked up in a king size bed. If all the rooms are like this then Ill be a happy man. If only this hotel had a pool/hot tub.  Get more pools/hot tubs lol That is all at this one. Ill let you know Monday or Tuesday my complaints if any at the next one.  Alright  now I know youre messing with me this new hotel has a pool I excitedly walk into this pool only to almost get hypothermia. Where are the pool heaters or hot tubs? This is the north. Good evening, I just got back to my hotel from work. So my stays are through work since I travel for work and I cant get the confirmation number. Its a pain because they dont let me do choice points either because Im not paying even though Im staying. The last hotel was  nights and they didnt give me any points. This time around were staying at best western for  nights and no points. It says heated pool, the guy assured me it was heated but its not warm at all. We climb cell towers and work on them  in the air all day so we look forward to being able to stay in a nice hotel and get taken care of after a hard day. I work outdoors, I understand cold haha I couldnt even swim in it. Personally I would upgrade breakfasts and try to get more pools/hot tubs. Youd have a lot more stays.

 -358-8685 - I cant talk at work, use email or here.  S Concord St Concord, Mi  My mistake, I was told we only stay in Choice hotels so it was under the assumption that was one. Im back into the comfort in air port for a couple nights because this is where my company is regularly used and the ladies you have working the front desk here are phenomenal. If you had a hot tub here Id be thrilled every time I stayed. These are nice hotels, Im not complaining, Im simply offering a suggestion to make it better. Ill try the breakfast in the morning and see how that is, thank you for reaching out, its awesome to see a company use social media for good. Allow for guests staying to use choice hotels points no matter who booked. My company pays for the rooms but they arent the ones in the room and they dont collect points either.

Thanks a lot! I had asked them when they checked me in and they said they couldnt do it in the system because I didnt use it to sign up the room. Thats so awesome! Thank you for that. Ill be sure to ask them again and let them know its possible. If not then Ill be sure to reach back out. Im not sure the next hotel yet but Ill be happy to keep you guys updated on our stays so you know how things are going. Again I really appreciate all of this. I wasnt expecting anything since it was just kind of a small complaint for no hot tub. Your team is excellent and Im happy to be staying in your hotels. You as well, thanks again. Its been  hours since my stay at the comfort inn if you could add MW1261 points thatd be awesome. The breakfast was great there too btw.

Staying at the Econo Lodge   Kraft Ave SE
Grand Rapids, MI 
Staying just tonight.
They also couldnt add my rewards number here due to being booked on Expedia with my job he said. So in  hours Ill ask for that.

Staff is great so far, room was nice and clean. I really like the set up of the rooms, again no pool or hot tub so thats a disappointment. Ill let you know how breakfast is here. Oh thats awesome. Sorry Fernando its not me that books them, its my work that does it so Im just trying to get points when I can at the right places. I dont have any control over the booking at all. I appreciate the points for the promotion too, I like choice hotels so Ill be happy to stay in them on my free time too. Your team has been amazing and since I live out of hotels its nice having a team I can rely on. Well Im back at the econo lodge in the same room I was in last time. This time Im not sure whats going on but this noise has been going on for a good  hours now and Im not sure what it is. It keeps waking me up and not only was yesterday an extremely hard day climbing cell towers because it was cold but it was super windy as well so you could imagine Im pretty tired. This is the first issue Ive had at any choice hotel but its a pretty aggravating one. This econolodge is pretty outdated with pretty much no amenities so its a disappointment to have to write you this. The company gets a great deal here and uses this place religiously so no doubt Ill be staying here many more times but not if Im choosing. I have to be up at :30am not a fun day doing dangerous activities on little sleep. Im not in the hotel, Ive been out since am working. Im actually not the only one on my crew that had the issue. It sounds like the plumbing there is what causes the issue. We both noticed someone was in a shower or using water when the noise was going on. Appreciate all your help and thank you for that. Were at a comfort in over in Utica, Mi for the night. Hotel staff as usual was amazing. Cant use points because work booked through Expedia again. Never had an issue with any staff members so far. Elvis is the front desk gentleman here and he was absolutely great. Rooms are nice here. Still the only complaint is no hot tub/pool/lack of amenities. I do love the direct tv here and so much to choose from. Im heading back to the econo lodge for the next  nights so well see how they go. I got lucky and it was full, all choice rooms were so Im at a holiday inn express. Ill let you know next time Im bunks up in a choice hotel next week. Thanks for all the help. Ive been in the comfort inn airport again in Grand Rapids for a  night stay so Ill get ahold of you guys Monday to see if we can add my rewards. Im not sure how she booked it but I think it was through the choice website this time. I believe its been the allotted time. MW1261 is my rewards number.

The parking lot wasn't full so we thought we'd have no problem getting a room. She couldn't be bothered We didn't have a reservation. The parking lot was basically empty (now we know why) so we thought we could get a room no problem. We were wrong. Michelle (if that's her real name) could barely pull away from her phone to ask us for our reservation. When we explained we didn't have one, she said we needed one bcuz ""that's how sh*ts done nowadays"". OK. Wow. And went right back to her phone. She was quite rude and down right inhospitable. Then we checked your website to see if a reservation was ""required"" and that's when we found all the negative comments about this woman. You guys must not read your reviews cuz if you did, you'd see that you've lost alot of potential repeat customers bcuz of this woman. Your choice who you employ. Just know we won't be staying at a Choice Hotel anytime in the near future. Or anyone else we know for that matter. This Michelle person needs a position within your company that doesn't deal with people. Customer service is NOT her Forte. You've been very attentive in this matter. It's unfortunate that her lack of customer service skills is the first thing guests are welcomed? With upon entering your hotel. That equates her sour disposition with the Choice Hotel name as that's what people will remember anytime Choice Hotels is mentioned. After looking at all the reviews on Google, i think its reasonable to assume that most of your  star ratings, center around her when they refer to rude front desk clerk. It's sad really. I hope we never have to encounter an individual like that at your hotels again. That is, if we decide to stay at one. Again, thank you for your swift response to this matter. I hope it all works out for you.","Michelle, the front desk clerk at your Meridian/Airport location in Okc, is absolutely the rudest creature I've ever met!

"I booked a  night stay at Wingate by Wyndham in Greenville Noth Carolina the weekend of March   through Expedia. When we checked in and went to our room (10pm), not only were some of the blankets and pillows dirty, but we could very clearly hear the people in the room next to us laughing and carrying on - note we had to get up at am the next morning and were told there was a no party policy and all guests needed to start quieting down at pm. We had to call the front desk THREE TIMES before the noise issue was remediated at AM. By  AM it was evident that there was a physical altercation and the police were called to physically remove these people from the hotel - which then carried over into the parking lot for another hour. 

The next morning when we go to take shower, there is ZERO water pressure and not only that but the water was FREEZING cold. So all of my guests that were with me, including myself, took a cold shower to the point where our finger nails were turning purple and had constant shivers. 

Upon checkout I informed the front desk who took down my information and told me I would hear from a manager Monday. Monday morning, afternoon and evening came and went without me hearing anything so I decided to call the hotel. NO MANAGEMENT ON STAFF. I was told to call Tuesday between the hours of am and pm. Tuesday I call during the hours I was told, NO MANAGEMENT ON STAFF. I was told a manager would be coming in at pm that day. I asked for a name and COULD NOT BE TOLD a name because their schedule was not posted. 

I call Wingate corporate and was directed back to expedia for a refund. I paid $105 dollars for a crappy stay at what I thought was a reputable hotel. Expedia informed me I would receive a $75 refund - NEVER RECEIVED. I continue to call Expedia and work with their customer service MULTIPLE TIMES - starting the process over and over and over each time. The first  calls i was told I would receive a refund. The th time Im told Wingate has now been bought out by Comfort Inn and have no record of my stay. I was offered a coupon, but who wants a coupon to another crappy night stay at a crappy hotel? I continued requesting a refund. Expedia opened a service request and could still not contact a manager. It was becoming clear that a refund was never intended and the coupon was offered to shut me up and end the conversation. 

I receive an email stating the hotel wanted to maintain their terms and conditions and I would not receive a refund but instead a $25 coupon. To that I ask, is this what your customers are worth to you?? $25? I will NEVER stay at another Wingate. I am HIGHLY disappointed in Expedia, Wingate by Wyndham and Comfort Inn for this horrible customer service, lack of quality in a hotel, and frankly just not caring. 

I hope no one has to experience what I did when using Expedia or staying at a hotel that they were under the impression is a nice hotel.

Expedia informed me I would receive a $75 refund - NEVER RECEIVED.,iââm told get refund phone hotel email says later,"I booked a  night stay at Wingate by Wyndham in Greenville Noth Carolina the weekend of March   through Expedia. When we checked in and went to our room (10pm), not only were some of the blankets and pillows dirty, but we could very clearly hear the people in the room next to us laughing and carrying on - note we had to get up at am the next morning and were told there was a no party policy and all guests needed"

"Hello in my search of trying to find head office that deals work comfort inn and suits I found your management company.

I had some big concerns with my room. I'm not a picky person I just really wanted clean sheets.. Manager and front desk people were horrible to deal with Before I put on Google and trip advisor etc I thought I would forward to hopefully a head office I am not picky but it's gross I just wanted clean sheets. I picked this hotel trying to stay close to a dying\palliative relative and lots of hotels were booked. I have my kids with me that i thought having a water slide and pool would help keep them entertained while dealing with my relatives needs. The hotels manager and front desk attendant attitudes sucks when you bring up concerns.. They tried to tell me the drips behind the one headboard was from covid cleaning measures. I highly doubt there is any covid cleaning measures happening here... we were leaving the hotel for two hours to be with our dying family member and they said they would put clean sheets on. We returned hrs later and nothing was done so i went to ask why. The manager finally offered me another room after he was getting embarrased of people over hearing me explain my issues and showing pictures. He showed me another room I pulled back the sheets infront of him  in the new room and those sheets were  stained and gross 
Comicon a big event was happening I  the city and hotel were limited. 

 I then checked out google reviews to see if anyone else had similar gross dirty room issues...  someone recently found used undergarment in their bed like wtf

I never did get new sheets, followed up on etc. The hotel was disgusting. After everything room a couple down from me had loads of people partying, music blaring way too many people in the room at am I had to call and ask the front desk what was going on. 

It was the worst stay at a hotel where everything felt super unclean This is a Google review that also confirms cleanliness issue there are many... Thank you I arrived April  paid the extra $30 for early checkin and left April  by am. My room # was  The room they eventually offered me was just up from my #203 room maybe  or  same side of the hallway. But I declined that  one because the sheets were stained when I peeled them back with the manager Name of the reservation was under my name I think or my husband's 
 ) Lannea Mcleod 
 )Jenman Luk 

I forgot who my husband booked it under when he called them Thanks for following up sorry I've been away in and out of the house with a family  member in palliative care. 

I just forwarded my issues to a higher level hoping that management issues at the hotel was dealt with. I don't need a anything in return I do appreciate all thr follow up and kind offer. But honestly I just hope my information gets to the right people to make positive changes. It was such a crazy experience and for or it to be this bad it didn't happen overnight.  It must have been  a long process of low standards that people higher up might not havd been aware of. 
I stayed at the days inn the two nights prior very similar hotel but i had such a great clean stay. I just couldn't believe it was such an opposite in experience from one hotel that was similar to this one. 

Please just forward my info to the right people is all that I ask. The manager and front desk people will hopefully be educated  how wrong this was. I was just shocked at how normal and unphased him and the frony desk person was with my concerns. Maybe hotel management isn't the right career choice for them. Or hopefully they will strive to do better. If the basic cleanliness is not prioritized what else are they missing \hiding. 

Thanks again for all your follow up. I appreciate it. Just send info to the right hands so they can be informed of what's going on

"I had a terrible experience at one in Allentown several years ago, a problem with housekeeping, and the manager at the desk didn't care. (He actually said those words.)  I said fine, in that case I'm not satisfied with my stay and I need a refund, and pointed to the sign on the wall where it says satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.  He said and I quote, ""Don't point at the sign, I don't care about that sign, I don't care that you're not happy, no refund, you can leave now.""  Not wanting to get arrested for trespass (or for strangling him with a telephone cord), I left.  Corporate customer service said they would look into it, believed the complete BS the manager told them, did absolutely nothing for me and said they ""considered the matter closed"".  I responded politely but assertively that everything the manager told them was a lie; they offered me $25.  I declined. They called to discuss, and I ended up with vouchers for three nights at any Choice location. Point being... if you have a problem, stay polite, don't take no for an answer, and don't accept any offer that you're not completely satisfied with:  it may take a few tries, but Choice customer service will eventually make it right.",The manager at the desk at Choice in Allentown didn't care about her complaints.

I ended up cutting short my conference attendance and drove home. I did not expect a five star stay for $60 a night but I also did not expect to stay in what looked like a crack den.

I left in tears after he wouldnt give me a room never again I cant believe someone would treat another person that way. Could you please call me  -6678 to discuss I arrived at the comfort inn at :55 the girl at the desk said she had no dog rooms ready and I should leave and come back.  I had been traveling since :00 am she didnt  offer a time I was the frustrated and said I thought check in was at :: she then told me it wasnt three yet I asked what time it was I said you got to be kidding me at that time the manager came out upset thinking I was not appreciative of his staff I never raised my voice swore or said anything about the staff he became more agitated I asked him to stop numerous times and to stop yelling at me I couldnt believe it I was frustrated but not angry. The girl then said she had a room on the second floor I said that was fine she asked me how big my dogs were when I told her she said we really dont want to take dogs and told me my dogs were not nine pounds each.  During the conversation I must have said stop giving me crap the the manager really started yelling and told me to leave.  I couldnt believe it I begged for a room and pleaded for him to stop I have never ever been treated so threatening and rude in my life.  There was absolutely no customer service I have been a nurse for  years never can understand how cruel this person was. He told me he didnt want my service and told me to get out he also said everything was recorded maybe some really needs to listen to it.  I left in tears so upset bothered me for days thinking how I could of handled it better even when I explained my situation he was so mean.  I will never stay in a hotel that would let a manager treat anyone the way he treated me.  I dont expect much maybe an apology he made me afraid I was thinking about calling the police but I left peacefully I never raised my voice I believe he really needs anger management and the girl was quiet just looking at me I am sure she didnt want to loose her job.

"Yeah really disappointed in Choice hotels right now. Had an employee that had to change locations the day before a scheduled trip. Sleep Inn Airport in Columbia, SC wouldn't cancel. Wouldn't even just charge  night. Manager was an absolute ass and wouldn't help us out. Won't be staying there again and letting everyone I know to avoid that property. Sincerely a Diamond member. Thank you for reaching out. It was the sleep inn Airport -A Airport Blvd, West Columbia, SC I am going to get dates and confirmation # E-mail from my employee after speaking to the GM: Good afternoon, 

 

I just hung up the phone with the GM at the Sleep Inn in Columbia. He bluntly told me he didn't care, I could not cancel and that room is available if I would like to come and stay this week. They are charging the whole week. He also stated not to have anyone else call because he would not talk to anyone other than the person who ordered the room. I'm sorry for this. 

 

thanks,

 Amber Amber Amerson member ANA6209 April  - April  confirmation #75232263 She called  days in advance to cancel and they were rude and hostile from the start. Tyoically we have been charged for  day on a no show but they refused and charged for the whole week. AND didn't even give her any points when charging us k. Her direct e-mail is  Not a problem at all. We will take that into consideration when booking future reservations. And as I told the very rude manager I will % make sure no other employee of ours stays at that property.","The Sleep Inn in Columbia, SC wouldn't cancel. Wouldn't even just charge night.

This is the front desk clerk telling me to book on YOUR website and she will give me a ground floor room. This is the SAME front desk clerk that told me when I arrived there were no ground floor rooms available and there was NOTHING she could do. She would not call the General Manager or the Owner of the hotel. We were forced to stay at a VERY DIRTY hotel as there was a basketball tournament going on and it was the only ground floor room available. I paid CHOICE HOTELS, not the hotel. I need a FULL REFUND from CHOICE HOTELS by MONDAY, MAY  or I will file in Shelby County Indiana Small Claims Court for breech of contract and ask for  times actual damages.

"WORST STAY EVER...I booked a room  days ago for tonight May th at Econo Lodge in Sheboygan, WI. and upon arrival there was a drug deal in the parking lot right in front of the desk clerk ( who was also outside). I figured it was too late to cancel and get my money back so I went to my room where the shower was broken away from the wall and my room smelled like it had just been fumigated. I checked out and went to another hotel. Unfortunately it is not a Choice Hotels chain but definitely worth the price. I appreciate your acknowledgement of my concerns. This is not a property that represents Choice Hotels. I have NEVER had to leave and find another hotel just to be sure I was safe. Im not happy about spending the $74 on a hotel I couldn't even stay at and Im more upset that I had to pay $165 for yet another room at a different hotel. Very disappointing.

The Killeen location is nice and their staff is pleasant. She even gave me  extra hours before checking out because I was tired and got off in the am.. The prices are the same + or  + depending on the room and dont forget the taxes of courses its gonna go up.

"On March th I booked a room for May th at Comfort Suites in Batesville, MS. I booked it online thinking I was using the choice hotels website since it was the first to come up when searching, and it looked a lot like the choice hotel website. Once I booked I realized my mistake and called the company immediately. They refused to do anything because it was  nonrefundable. Since I still needed the reservation I didn't go any further.  Now, our tournament has been canceled and I can't cancel the room through the company and get any of the money back that I spent. I also tried calling the hotel directly and choice hotels.  They both told me that there was nothing that could be done because I booked through this company.  I asked both the hotel and the  choice gotel representative if I could use the credit for another room, they also refused that. So now I've paid for a service I will never receive.  CMM1006

" nothing like the internet not working nor the does the support line. Of course the front desk girl made it sound like its normal around here now. Awesome. The Comfort Suites I stayed at had no internet service except for a few rooms nearest the router. When I notified the front desk the employee didnt sound surprised nor did she sound like there was much of anything she could or would do about it. I also tried calling the toll free support number but that number is out of service. It was the same experience for both nights we were there for me and my coworkers.

Stay away from Econo Lodge Portland Airport. They charged my card $275 they claim for a broken TV. I am a quiet and cautious person and traveler. I am on a vacation to get out into nature didnt even touch the TV. Kept calling me sir #discrimination #trans   Yeah they kept calling me sir from the start and the phone call with them today. So rude. Like I am on a calm and chill nature vacation. Im not going around breaking things??? Im calling legal aid tomorrow if its not refunded immediately.  Choice Hotels is not helping. Offering me points toward a free $60 stay at another econo lodge (which might try to also take advantage of me, a trans person) and no accountability for the $275 fraudulent charge. I guess because I am transgender it is safe to assume I am a baddie  Still no accountability from  Since I am transgender its where Econo Lodge and Choice hotels stands that it is okay to assume I am at fault. Trans folks, especially trans women, stay away from this Portland location as the management obviously has it out for us. Paying the #trans tax, when people or orgs take from you extra because of your identity.   charged me $275 for a broken tv they insinuate I had lots of people coming in and out. I am a professional and single parent. If I was cis this would not happen I was the only one in the room. Flight got in late for my vacation to Oregon to enjoy the great outdoors and I went to bed. No time or money to go around breaking tvs. This is the #trans tax and price we pay to exist.  trans folks stay away from Portland location  I have done this already and still no appropriate response. I dont want a few points for the inconvenience. I want and need my $275 back.","Econo Lodge Portland Airport charged me $275 for a broken TV.

"Issuing a yet another formal complaint re: the continuing issues with garbage from the Rodeway Inn in McDermitt, NV blowing onto my adjacent private property.  This is another example of the trash I pick up daily  including dirty diapers, bottles filled with urine, and used face masks.  The conditions on these premises are unsanitary and this has now become a safety issue for my pets and family. We are seeking an immediate resolution to this ongoing problem.  We understand that each hotel is individually owned and operated but the condition of the premises is still a reflection on Choice hotels and the owners need to be held accountable for the day-to-day operations at the hotel.

" Im absolutely appalled with  and how they treat Army personal just needed a place to stay for a night while on training. We are having THE WORST experience with them.!  has given us the worst experience of our lives and the way they treat Army personal is awful. Im sick to my stomach.  not only have you made your customer service the worst experience for us a choice rewards members but for military as well. Idk what is wrong with your customer service  over the phone but that is not a way to treat rewards members as well as military personal just trying to get a room for a military training!! Hi the hotel was the Sleep Inn Macon -75 address  River Place Dr Macon Ga , check in date was today /12 confirmation number . The situation is my husband is in the army he gets sent to Macon each month my husband has stayed at this hotel each time well he is a firefighter and was tired and accidentally booked the hotel for today /12 he goes to his army on /14 so he called choice customer service and they said their was nothing they could do he wouldnt get his money back and its not their problem. We tried calling the hotel  times they took their phone off the hook. We just lost $80 on top of it I had to rebook the same hotel for the /14 date which I did so through this time because of the issue we just had today. Customer service did not care it was important for him to switch his date he could not miss a military training day. So we lost $80 when all that had to happen was switching the date  days! Clearly we still rebooked and paid $100 so now we have paid a total of $180. The name on the reservation is Jason Proctor. If the hotel wouldve just answered the phone we may have gotten more help then choice hotels customer service over the phone My for the rebooking confirmation is confirmation no.: , so you can clearly see we still rebooked but after this probably not anymore because they couldnt give us our $80 back and we had to pay another $100 we are a military family we dont make enough money to be doing that. Thank you so much! This is why we stay at Choice hotels we appreciate your time on this   Oh no I hope you get it fixed.

Robert Dennis     home phone is (830) -7337   cell is (830)275-8227 I guess you can just go ahead and remove me from your membership list and dont count on me to use Choice Hotels anymore. This issue doesnt happen with any other hotel family website, only yours. I have gone to the local library to try this-same result. I have used a friends computer-same result. I do use my email as a user name Im done, Im through with this i never can get that far because the website wont give me that information This is what happens every single time on my phone I have tried random dates and cities trying to get the site to work, with no success. I have done all those things. glitches to your website are the only choice left. If there are no glitches, explain the screenshot I sent you. Please remove my name from your member list. On the computer, your website tells me you dont have any locations in places like Chicago, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Houston, etc. It says that about every city I enter. Yes, your website has glitches, severe glitches. I just tried it  more times. Your website is non functional and has severe glitches. How do I cancel my membership? If there werent any glitches, we wouldnt be having this conversation and I never would have called customer service to begin with. Just a random sampling from my computer. This happens with every city that I enter. I am using Google Chrome And my phone uses Safari neither one works Can you restore my membership, or at least my points? Fix your website so a person can check room rates. Fix your website I have noticed that the website works for Canadian cities, by not U.S. cities. We have been through all this before. Mobile app doesnt work, website doesnt work, none of the browsers work, except on the case of Canadian cities. You have gotten numerous reports from me about website not working I will give you that long to fix the problem.If it isnt fixed, I will ask my account to be permanently deleted and I will never do business with Choice Hotels again! Why wont you admit there is a problem with the website? Do you treat all customers this way? I have sent screenshots of the issue, only to be net with denial. How obvious does it have to get?","Your website is completely non functional and unusable. I cant even access my own account. Your website is still completely non functional.

(314)766-2248 OR (314) -5044 I'm sorry but this doesn't help! I know what the promotion says ""Stay  Separate Nights and Earn A Free Night"". The standard of hotels we stayed in and usually stay in require ,000 points. Choice only applied ,000 points to our account, earned the rest for previous stays! I think it's false advertising and poor marketing to promote stay  separate stays and earn a free night when the points you awarded us somg qualify us for a free night at the same or equal standard hotel that we stayed in during the promotion. Your explanation doesn't help and I'm still furious at the lack of understanding for your consumers who work hard for their money and chose to trust in your ad! I'd like to be compensated for a free night at the same standard hotel we stayed in during the promotion. Please award us the remainder of the ,000 points. I dont think it's right because NO ONE knows what the points that are needed until they attempt to get the free night that is advertised.

I went back to the hotel and they would not even look for the bag. Hoping I could talk to somebody different I went back on May th before I came back to Minnesota to see if someone else would look for my bag. They refused again and told me I had to go on a site I left my stuff.com. I had a hard time finally getting in touch with somebody that would actually do something about it. Finally on May rd I believe it was I got a hold of a woman named Angie and housekeeping and she checked for my things and said it was hidden back behind some stuff in whatever room they keep things that were left there ,that's probably know why nobody found it. So now I asked how do I get my things back and she told me I have to go to I left my stuff website to make arrangements to get my things back but I will have to pay for it to be shipped to me. I would like to know why do I have to pay for something that they would not even bother looking for while I was there twice. The first time with the same day I left the hotel just a few hours later because I had to attend a funeral first. I'm contacting you in hopes that you can somehow get my things back to me without me having to pay for it. Now I realize that it was my fault I left it there but, I also went back there a couple hours after I left and there was no reason that they could not have went in that room and look for it. And like I said I went back again a few days later and they still refuse to look for it.

Firstly, the front desk staff were incredibly unprofessional, both in how they were dressed, and how they acted. They werent helpful, and it almost seemed as if asking them a question was bothering them. They forgot to hand out the brides wedding bags to the guests, which was disappointing. It made us very uncomfortable when we needed to talk to the staff. Secondly, the complimentary breakfast was pathetic. There was no fresh fruit, a couple of granola bars and some bagels. It was not up to standards of a continental breakfast. Lastly, several guests in the bridal party complained of bugs in their room, which is terrible and so embarrassing. The stay here was not worth our money at all. Thank you for that. I do not have an account - are you able to use the points for a voucher for a free night?

Also, I have been waiting for  months to get reimbursed from the hotel. You said you would take care of this if I DM'd you. Instead, I'm still having to call and follow up again. It's been  months of doing the same thing. No one has time to keep calling and calling and calling. That's why I made the tweet in the first place. My email address is  Thank you for the additional points  And, while I understand what you're saying, I'm at Med Express right now because my wife just cut her knee on a bed at yet another Choice Hotel. It's really a shame that these franchise businesses are operating with no real accountability or consequences. I'm a Diamond Elite member because of how much I use your network of hotels. Won't happen again -- I was hoping that the bed bugs was an isolated incident. But now I see that the lack of accountability is par for the course with Choice Hotels and the corporation won't intervene with the exception of offering a few points.  Unfortunately, though you are publicly acting as if you're being proactive, your company is not willing to step in and take accountability for your individual franchised hotels.    We've been waiting for over  months to be reimbursed for our laundry bill and groceries.  Calling and emailing over and over for months on end is a full-time job and I am not getting paid. No customer should have to call and call and call to receive a refund after experiencing bed bugs in the middle of the night and being forced to go to another hotel.  Keep in mind, we had to pay an early check-in fee for the other hotel. They did not do anything except refund us our stay. 

They did not pay for our laundry. You see the receipt that I attached where I paid for my own laundry. Ask them to provide the receipt from paying for my laundry. 

They did not send the money for our groceries. Ask them for a receipt showing the payment.

They said they were putting in a claim with the insurance company and there has been no communication from them since then.      My wife bent down to pick something up and this is what happened I reported it to the front desk. We simply got an apology.

Good evening, I just tried to use the points that were added to my account and was told that this hotel requires a $250 cash deposit when you're using points, which is not listed on the Choice Hotels app anywhere. Now, they have locked my reservation and are saying that it cannot be cancelled and won't be reviewed until tomorrow morning. Can you please help me? The staff says there's nothing they can do. Unfortunately, after my wife was injured at another Choice Hotels earlier, we spent the entire day at the hospital. I didn't see the $250 Cash-only deposit until I got here. We are still sitting in the parking lot I'd honestly just like to be able to sleep We spent the entire day at Med Express And, now we go to use the points you just gifted us and we can't actually use them I'm just asking for the points to be returned so we can book elsewhere We are being told there's nothing the hotel staff can do about it Please, I'm sitting here with my wife, who has stitches from the injury at our hotel this morning, and my children We would just like to be able to sleep Any updates?

"To whom it may concern, 

Something needs done about your hotel in New Columbia, PA. I cant begin to fathom how these employees got hired at the front desk, and also housekeeping. What a clown show. 

I reserved two rooms and the conference room. I threw a baby shower for my daughter. We had about  guest. My fianc and I arrived the night before. Several times the front desk got my instructions wrong for the rooms. Ill admit I did change my mind about the room situation a couple times, but they kept getting the info wrong. It was hard to communicate with them. 

My fianc gets employee discounts since he travels and renovates hotels all over. He called about a room and (I think was John), was very rude to him. So I called back. He was ok with me, but odd. 

But what happened Saturday night is insane. We were checking out the conference room and noticed the floors werent swept and tables were dirty. It was also super hot and muggy so we opened door. (They brought a fan for the next day but the room was so disgustingly hot, people were miserable). We asked the front desk if they would clean the room before the next morning or should we sweep it and wipe tables. The girl with the bandana on her head assured us they would. She was nice. No issues with her. Then we went back to the conference room to plan how we would decorate it the next day. 

Suddenly we hear screaming and yelling. 

We walk down to the corner and head to front desk where the noise is coming from. We see the girl with bandana screaming at the employee that has just arrived for her shift. The girl with bandana was screaming that she sits on her fat ass all day. Earlier a woman by the last name of packer (nickname Duff) had ran and hid when she saw the new employee walk in. She voiced that she couldnt stand her.  Duff was dressed so inappropriately for a business setting. Very unkempt. The new girl waking in was actually dressed professional.  

When we approached the front desk to see if everything was ok, the employee that was new on the scene yelled at me and told me to mind my own business and got nasty with me. I responded with wow. And she became enraged. I told her I was calling corporate. She then starts bawling and telling her life story. She said her daughter had just been life-flighted for a mass on her ovaries and then said she (herself) was on disability for  years and her husband works maintenance at that hotel. I told her she shouldnt have come in. I told her she should be with her daughter. But she said she would be fired. I explained to her that no one is that heartless and they cant fire her for a crisis. And during these times hotels are desperate for help. It shows by the people that were working those two days that hotels are definitely desperate.  

Meanwhile the woman with no teeth, and dressed so trashy, was hiding and recording the scene between the two other employees and shes motioning for me to be quiet so she could record. I ignored her. 

We left and shook our heads in disbelief. I couldnt wrap my mind around what just happened. But it doesnt end there. 

We got to our room and theres a dehumidifier in the room and the room smelled moldy. But the room appeared clean. No complaints there. But the next morning we had a DND sign on the door and the housekeeping walked right in!! We kept telling her to leave but she was talking. I wasnt dressed! We told her we got a late checkout for :00 since we were changing rooms to put things in the next room for my daughter. But it was around noon she did this, I believe. Ill have to check times. We still left a tip for her. 

But the room we got my daughter (mother to be) was the king jacuzzi room and there was wet floor around the doorway near bathroom and dehumidifier in her room. The room was clean. My daughter enjoyed her room very much but when she was leaving, she walked out back door, and saw several employees smoking out of glass pipes that smelled like cat pee! She believed it was meth. It was definitely not marijuana. This would explain so many things we witnessed. It would make it all make sense. 

I also want to add that Sundays staff was very strange. They had a dog barking and trying to attack if we even got near the desk! Im terrified of strange dogs. It was a smaller black and white dog. It wouldnt shut up. It kept trying to jump up over the desk! I was there because my key card didnt work for the king room. There was also a very large man in shorts. So unprofessional and gross. They all acted like a scene from the three stooges. 

Not all the employees were bad. We did see an old friend working there who is the son of Doctor ward. Darin ward. He was very friendly. He was working on the pool to get it opened. We did not know he worked there. So not all was bad about our stay. The shower went well. But I will be leaving a review. That hot mess of a hotel, needs revamped. Do better vetting with employees. We shouldnt feel like were stuck in an episode of the Beverly Hillbillies. I trust you will look into this. 

Thank you! Thank you for getting back to me. The hotel rooms were under Bob Pringle and Melanie white. The stays were May th and May th. I will have to get the confirmation number. Thank you so much for looking into this! I didnt get a confirmation for the Sunday night stay we arranged for our daughter.

The key didn't work! Strike ! So we go back down and tell him that the key didn't work. He programs it for a different room (402). It doesn't work there either. This time I called downstairs, and he comes up. While waiting, my friends noticed that there was a white powdery substance around the threshold of the door across the hall. She says ""is that roach powder?"" By that time, Mr. Concierge comes up. I say ""Hey! Do you guys have roaches?"" He told me that he wasn't allowed to tell me that and precedes to open up room ...

"Good afternoon. I am an Associate of a Choice Hotel. I recently found out that Choice Associates are not eligible to receive rewards, or ""points"", for their stay since we receive a lower price than other Choice Customers.

When I called in this afternoon to Choice Customer Service, the Call Center Representative reiterated Choice Associates were ineligible for the rewards.

The reason for my persistence Associates should be eligible for rewards is to keep up with the competing Hotel Brands and to retain Associates.

IHG Hotel Associates and Marriott Associates are eligible to receive points at their Associate Rates .... their rewards are based on the dollar amount they spend at the property; meaning it takes time for Associates to obtain the higher rewards membership.

When I asked for a manager, the Call Center Representative refused to transfer me to a manager.

I am a former Marriott Call Center Representative, when a customer -- Associate or not -- asked to speak with a Manager, I was obligated to transfer the customer to a manager.

My Account Number is WBS02050 .... I am being persistent with my question not because I am a Platinum Member prior to becoming a Choice Hotel Associate but because I am faced with financial hardship. I have been looking for a new place to live and have been using my paychecks to keep a roof over my head. As I do not have the funds to pay for a room until my next paycheck, the points or rewards I would have accrued the last  days for two rooms could help me pay for a few nights until my next paycheck and/or my apartment is available this week.

Thank you.

I also check details of my account balance regularly. Its very hard to accumulate points to stay at hotels in the area we go to. Since  weve only received  free night out of many paid nights. On our trip to Florida we would get told that Choice only allows so many discount rooms a night and they wouldnt give us the discount. But we could call choice booking and let them book. 
Ok great but. If its pm or even midnight and you call it takes forever to get that call completed to be able and just get checked in. Thus you give up. Agents always want to discuss other travel plans, give offers, GET your credit card number so they can RESERVE thus wonderful offer.
WE just wanted to get a room and go to bed. So no discount, full price paid and very few points due to hotels not being priced high enough.
Its all a racket! Well of coarse I needed to reserve thru your not online service and that would be fine when your planing based on flying but driving across country your never sure where you will stop. Then add that online doesnt always work so Id call and try to do it but your phone people are so worried about booking us a cruise or extended trip to some other destination that your forced to just check in.
