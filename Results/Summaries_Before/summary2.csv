"Hi. I have a question regarding my lumea Hi. I have never been able to leave it more than  weeks before hair grows back. Can I just carry on using it in this way? It is frustrating as if I leave it over .5 weeks then I have to start over again ! I have been through the full cycle but in the maintenance section had to continue every  weeks. Once the cycle ended it grows back after  weeks. If that makes sense? It says enjoy  days hair free but no chance of that So my question is- is it normal for hair to do this? For me taking  weeks break would mean all the hair has grown back I am back to square one so I can't do that. Zapping every  weeks keeps it from growing though. You recomend -6! 
Secondly is it safe to use it every two weeks for months/ years on end to ensure no regrowth?

This one we have to restart it anytime anyone wants a coffee, about  or  times a day. Every time we turn it back on, we have to wait about a minute for it to be ready to brew coffee, and at the end of that minute it always squirts out a couple of ounces of plain water. If you don't have a cup under it, it just runs into the drip tray. If you have a cup under it it catches the water, but then my expresso is diluted.

Sonic electric toothbrush HX6321/02 This was the tooth brush I bought for my  year old.  Not knowing it didn't come with the correct toothbrush heads for her age. And the toothbrush is really big & not real user friendly for a  year old. It's misleading that the age range starts at  years old for this toothbrush. Yes sorry She's .5 years old The toothbrush head that comes with the handle is for older kids. You state that the product is for  years on up. And the handle is BIG and its just not easy for her to handle If that's true why do you sell smaller toothbrush heads? I'm the one who brushes her teeth with it and it's big for a tiny little mouth You should offer an option to select the smaller toothbrush heads.

Hello I would like to get some help to see if I can get a replacement head Sorry replacement brush The brush that I have has no power in the vibration. It just makes the noise I took the head off and cleaned it real good and that helped a bit It seems as the actual piece that the brush head is supposed to go on is misaligned I move it with my fingers and the power in the vibration comes back Once I remove my hand off the power goes away  This is the model number on the bottom of the brush It isnt the battery. We have made sure it was fully charged multiple times. So I guess vibrating less powerfully. It is happening in all modes Apologies.

"Hi. I bought the MG7715 trimmer barely months ago. Stopped working. Warranty claim was a bit of a hassle so I opened it up to find moisture in the inner housing. Its supposed to be waterproof. Care to explain?    Hi. Cant seem to locate the purchase receipt. You can reach me at   Obviously I didnt dunk the trimmer in a tub of water. Just washed the head under a tap. In this case clearly seems like a manufacturing defect rather than misuse or abuse. Would certainly need it. Just not sure how it will be carried out. Will someone come to my place to do it?

What causes my electric toothbrush base to turn yellow? I paid hundreds of dollars for it approximately  years ago. It still works well. Is it meant to be disposable? That isn't environmentally or budget friendly. I like to keep my stuff. 

Had I known the UV light bulb could be replaced I would have kept mine instead of throwing it out. The packaging did not state that. Why?

How does it clean it?

I use soap and water to clean my heads.
https://t.co/zJXzMzOVF7  What do you mean by how ""we"" maintain it? Perhaps water discolored the handle or toothpaste. I had no idea either are yellowing-agents, I thought both cleaned things. Thanks for responding!  I try to hold onto everything for many years. I appreciate the quality of good products and don't like to waste too much of my time and money shopping.

I want to buy Philips oxygen concentrator l/m , location Delhi.
Chasing it every where but not getting correct information.
Hoping that I will get solution from here. Dear concern, have contacted every one but not even a single dealer has it.

I request any senior to Intervene and provide solution. Already mailed , but no response. I am strange that company like Philips is unable to provide a single unit. That means as a company, you won't be able to assist.and you don't have a single unit in entire Delhi. This is quite strange Don't know about your internal processes, but with a hope I had written directly to company.

Yes I will be very disappointed if I am unable to procure even from the company.

I have  number  nipples that I bought and they keep collapsing while trying to feed my baby. I have to pull the nipple sideways away from the valve at least  times during feeding. Is there something wrong with these nipples? I never had to do this with the zero and one nipples I dont have the packaging for the model numbers nan I also do not have receipts only a barcode on the target app. Two of them I bought recently the other two were a baby shower gift. I live in USA   I have gone on your tips page and also on YouTube and none of that helps the nipple is still collapsing atleast  times during feeding constantly having to fix it while my son is trying to eat No thank you these nipples are brand new and bought two more from the store and its still doing it  and I dont think buying more is going to help. I make sure they are cleaned properly and lined up correctly I will just have to try a different brand,I have number nipples that I bought and they keep collapsing atleast times during feeding.

"Hello Philips

"Just bought my last Phillips piece of equipment. Boughtba tv and gad to have major repairs within  years  under warranty. And dead within  years. Terrible craftmanship, just a heads up.

"Hello!  We recently purchased the Level , Natural nipples for our baby.  We had been using the Level  for many months.  We have found that the s seem more flimsy and easily concave inward as our child is drinking from the bottle.  We actually had to throw away one of the nipples because it sunk in consistently.  We never had this issue with the previous nipples.  Is there a difference in materials, or an explanation as to what we must be doing incorrectly with the newest ones?  We really enjoy all of the Avent products and hope to find a solution to this.  Thanks! Hello-

Ik heb het open gemaakt en kan zien dat de elektronica is uitgebrand. Is niet zozeer slijtage als wel een productiefout of misschien wel een ontwerpfout. Intussen zal ik een ander apparaat moeten kopen, want dit krijg je niet meer economisch gerepareerd, als ik berhaupt al aan reserve-onderdelen kan komen.

"Hi,

I bought the Philips Lumea from John Lewis on th March. I have used as per the instructions and have now finished my  weeks of using it every  weeks. Unfortunately, it hasnt worked at all, despite the fact I have the right skin colour and hair colour. Are you able to offer any advice? Im going to try it again in  weeks, but if it doesnt work, am I able to get my money back? Thanks, Hannah Hi there, thank you for your response.

I have been using setting , as this was the one suggested when I looked at my skin colour etc.

Its stored and cleaned correctly, and I shave the morning before using it. So I believe I am using it correctly. 

Ill give it another few weeks to see if it makes any difference.

I wanted to check about the  day return policy. If I bought it on th March from John Lewis, please can you advise me as to when I would need to make contact again, should the product still not be working?

Thank you for the tips etc.

The first one just stopped working, and this new one (only months old) first stopped mid brush cycle and started buzzing. The would randomly start again and not shut off. Now it's a combination of both those things along with buzzing,,,. Then it will turn on by itself. I have requested a replacement from your site. My concern is that this will happen again soon. I can't afford to replace a toothbrush every few months. I're in the US, California. Thank you nan nan"
"Hi there, could you give me a contact telephone number for the television department - the one on your website doesnt seem to work. Thank you. Hi - that number doesnt work!! It says not recognised everytime i call it!! Unfortunately having problems with the TV now and all within the first year of its purchase. Slightly alarming. Now probably /5 times a week when we turn the TV on, there is sound but no picture - just a blank screen.

"I recently purchased a Philips trimmer and it was working fine until today. I trimmed my beard and now it turns on by itself. I turn it off and then later on it goes back again to turning on.

Is there a way I can turn it off completely because I am very worried about nighttime when I will be asleep and it gets heated up when it buzzes so it blow up and cause problems. I use it without attaching it to the charger, when the battery dies, I plug it and let it charge for further use after the battery of the trimmer is fully charged.

"To whom it may concern:

I purchased  sets of Avent baby bottles on May th. One of the (#1) nipples that came with the bottles is defective and does not vent and would collapse into itself. 

Can I get a replacement? The valve on the defective nipple does not open when I get to step #3.

"Hi Pillips. I recently bought a Philips Series  BT5515/15 Beard Trimmer from Amazon, but when I got it I realized that it cane with a special charger and plug that I have never seen before. I like Phillips products and I'm sure it's a very good trimmer, but I returned it because of the plug. My old Remmington trimmer charges with standard micro usb plug, So I will go for that Remmington again. I hope that I'll find a Phillips trimmer with some kind of standard charge plug next time.
Regards, Thorkild Zinck No. I mean that it was a special charger (from Phillips ?) If I lose it, I would have to buy a new or maybe even a new trimmer, if I forget to bring it I cannot use another standard charger. My old charger simply charged with the same charger as my phone (standard USB) nan nan","My old Remmington trimmer charges with standard micro usb plug, So I will go for that Remmington again.

If an IT person can break it in about  hrs then I fear for non IT people. Any recommendations on the deleting the pairing on the machine side so I can try to reconnect the app? Also dont appear to be able to upload data from the as card. Seems like a lot of talk about features and not a lot of actual features.

Good evening. I am not sure if you can see my previous message history but in Dec  you replaced my sonicare toothbrush. My toothbrush appeared to run out of charge this morning so I placed it on the charging base. Around an hour ago I went to take it off and it was vibrating and beeping. I placed the toothbrush on the side and it turned itself on and wont let me turn it off. It has been doing it every few minutes for the last hour. I will try to attach a video now for you to see... nan I took it off as it was vibrating and beeping consistently. I usually leave my toothbrush over night but it has never made this noise before. Thank you!  Thanks Maria. I have just tried it and its not doing anything  Thank you for the offer Maria but if I need to repurchase I think I will try a Braun as despite really loving the look of the sonicare they havent lasted long enough for the money they cost,My sonicare toothbrush appeared to run out of charge this morning so I placed it on the charging base.

"The guard on my  Philip is one blade (model qp6520) has broken for a second time.  The first time I paid for a replacement guard, plus $25 shopping, import fees and duties.

I love the razor, but the guard has broken twice during normal use (I.e.was not dropped) and its upsetting to be looking at another $50 for the replacement.

"Hello there.

I have purchased numerous soothers of your brand - like  plus purchases.  They have been my go to and used for my kids and replaced regularity.

I was sterilizing them and noticed that water was getting INSIDE the soother!! 
I was shocked. Never has this happened for us in all of the soother we have purchased.   These ones must be defective or something?  I cant imagine water in there could be a good thing and assume that mold would start to grow or something.

"Wonderful machine, But how do propose to empty the bean tank for cleaning the funnel when it is un detachable !  I wanna clean the funnel right now but there are still some beans in the tank !  its the HD7762  Saudi Arabia  Hello, yeah Ive already read the instruction manual in detail first thing before operating the machine, theres no mention of how to empty the bean tank, it just says that it is preferable that its empty! So I settled on waiting for the tanks to be nearly empty and then run several cycles of grinder cleaning until it cleans on an empty tank, there will be wastage but thats the only way that worked for me! Maybe in future models you can add a mechanism to empty tanks of remaining beans before the cleaning process !

"Hi, I just wanted to share my great customer experience with you. I bought a Phillips electric toothbrush from Aldi at the end of last year. Unfortunately it stopped working at the weekend. I searched for any paperwork I could find but unfortunately in the hectic Christmas present season I appeared to have mis-filed it (in the recycling no doubt!). I called your customer services team yesterday lunchtime and immediately connected to a very helpful guy called George. After explaining the situation and emailing over a photo of the serial number a replacement was arranged. Was amazed when the doorbell just rung to find my replacement being delivered - less than hrs after my phone call. Its often so easy to moan when things go wrong, but I think its really important to recognise when things go right! So thanks to George (what a lovely friendly and helpful team member of yours!) and all involved in my great customer experience!

"Grain Master Rice Cooker White HD4514/72

This rice cooker does not cook white rice to an acceptable standard. The rice is dry and not even slightly fluffy. Have used the right amount of water was per the instruction manual. To make things worse, once the rice finished cooking you open the lid and a huge amount of water that have condensed on the inner lid flows back down to the pot.

Brought in Australia,  how do i go about returning this product for a refund. Brought last week and used it  times, terrible white rice everytime The main issue is when the rice us cooked I open the lid and the moisture on the lid flows back down to pot, and I mean a lot of water not just drips. Also I have tried all the above advice you mentioned, still below average rice.

"Hi I was bought a Phillips hair trimmer a couple of Christmass ago due to having sensitive skin on my legs. I've used it no problem until today. I haven't used it in a few months due to a flare up.

The case has split and the blade it exposed! Surely this should not happen?

It's only used be myself and only on my legs a few times a year due my sensitivity. 

It's never been in water or dropped etc.

"Hi, I just bought a toothbrush maybe  months ago. It's battery is either not charging or not lasting long enough to last even one cycle. Can you help?  My last Philips brush lasted for about  years. It died so I decided to pry open the bottom to see if I could do anything. It was full of water and i was able to get it working for a while. I just pryed open this one this morning. No water  but I hope that doesn't void any warranty Ok will do But the brush used to just indicate no battery with the the  pulses. Now it's entirely unresponsive. Will try charging for  hrs. Thanks The brush is unresponsive Morning, 
So I bought another toothbrush. I tried charging my old toothbrush that wasn't working on the new charger and now it works normally. So it was the charger after all, not the toothbrush. Now I have two brushes lol. Thank you for your help :)","My last Philips brush lasted for about years. It died so I decided to pry open the bottom to see if I could do anything.

I purchased a full mask and piping for my Philips sleep apnea machine through the local chemist near where I live. 
After about three or four months I took the inner part of the mask out to have a look at because I felt that I wasnt getting the right pressure while breathing. 
I noticed the plastic/ skin there had peeled off about and inch and a half long and was basically not breathing properly after only three or for months. 
Now I went back to the chemist and they said that was there understanding that there is no warranty with this sort of issue. 
Three to four months old. 
My previous one lasted seven years before I renewed it.

" are you going to inform here about your recall of CPAP devices because of carcinogenic foam?  Thanks. But why do you recall the devices in the US, but only give a security notice in the rest of the world?   The company that provided me with the device has exchanged it with one from a different manufacturer (I think they would have anyway as the old one was about  years old). Try contacting your provider.   Ah, I've just read, that yours was provided by the NHS. Do you have something like a local NHS support number to call?

 Wait you post this as you issued a massive recall telling us to stop using our machines immediately. I cannot sleep properly without my CPAP. What is your solution? We need it immediately.

Do they used the same heads as we have spent quite a bit buying them to have on hand as needed?

Do they use the same charge base?

We do not own the model you speak of & last time we changed models, no components were compatible or interchangeable between our older & newer toothbrushes. If all is cross compatible I am fine with the replacements.

"A recall of the cpap machines and the information on  your web site could not be more obscure if you tried.  For example, you tell patients to contact the physicians to find out information; however, today is /15 and you say that you are not providing information on exactly which machines are affected until /23.  A little dumb, don't you think?  You have listed models that ""may"" be affected, however, when one looks at the machine, the name of the models does not match what is actually printed on the machine illustrated.  For example, I have a Dreamstation.  I have no idea if it is Model  or  because the model number printed on the machine says it is DSX500T11C.  No where that I see do  you provide patients with a cross reference.  You are creating confusion instead of clarity.  You are making a simple task complicated by not empowering patients with correct and complete information.

"Hi,

I have a  Ambilight TV which is synced with my Philips Hue (two Playbars under the TV). 

The TV won't acknowledge any of the bulbs on my Hub and thus won't connect. 

I've reset the TV more times than I can count and resynced the Hub also. Tried everything that normally works short of a software update. Usually when I reach this stage (as this unfortunately isn't the first time) a patch gets released for the TV and hey presto problems solved. 

All software on all devices is up to date. Can you confirm when a fix will be coming please as my main reason for owning the TV and investing in Hue is the Ambilight which is amazing when it works but that's only -90% of the time. Hi Benoit,

Thank you for pointing me in the right direction and I hope you enjoyed the weekend. 

Have a great week.

"Hello!
I am wondering if you have any hairdryers in your collection that does NOT contain teflon, ptfe or other contents that may be toxic or emit toxic gasses into the air?
The reason this is extremely important is because I rescue birds and will be using the hairdryer on the birds, and these gasses could kill the birds.
Hope to hear from you soon. I am situated in Norway, just in case this is relevant in regards to what products are sold where.
With kind regards
Nina Thank you so very much for you kind and quick response. I've had a look through the page you sent me, and from what I can see, it seems all your hairdryers have the ionic effect, which is great for hair (if I was bying to use for myself, I would love that), but unfortunately one of the things that are scary for birds. 
I do appreciate the costumer service, though!

Hi. I've got a Philips BT9299 beard trimmer that's just over  months old. The beard guard comb thing on top has snapped on the side .I can't seem to find a replacement which means I can't now actually use the trimmer anymore. Bearing in mind the beard comb is pretty flimsy plastic anyway I find it strange there is not a replacement. Having spent nearly  can't say I'm impressed. Any suggestions? Thank you. It's  nan nan nan Hi. I've contacted them but out of stock so I'm on a waiting list. I have to say I find it incredible that Philips don't have a range of beard combs in stock. Given they are only made of plastic it's inevitable they will break at some point way before the blades or motor give up. A plastic blade comb must cost pennies to make yet without it renders an expensive shaver utterly useless.

Hi my daughter uses A40 bipap machine every night due to her having muscular dystrophy. Obviously we have seen these machines being recalled. We have contacted the hospital who provided this machine to be told they are investigating. But to me there is then a delay and my daughter's health could be badly affected whilst waiting for the investigation to take place. I don't feel this is good enough and as a company you should be telling hospitals to recall the equipment. Please advise Sam Greenway Well I don't believe it's faulty.

"Hi Philips, 

It's been more than two weeks, and I have received neither my order nor a refund. I contacted customer service five times. However, I am still waiting for an update. The way Philips treats its customers is very unprofessional. They should learn how online business works and customer service. I am disappointed with the company because of its operations.

Why no info on the recall? Heard about it from my Dr. Called your  number Thursday and spoke to a csr who was rude and told me my unit was not included.

"  Hi Philips. I have a question about one of your shavers, and I was wondering if I could speak to someone please? Thanks. Hello. Thanks for getting back to me. I ordered the Philips OneBlade Hybrid. It says its QP2520/30. It came with one of those two-pin chargers that you find in some bathrooms, which is okay since I happen to have one in my apartment, but I was wondering if there are any adaptors or anything like that available so I can charge it normally? Its just that it would be difficult for me to charge it when Im not at my apartment, as I dont see those sorts of two-pin sockets in many places. Thank you, Chris.

"Hi. I own  Philips Aquatouch shavers and bought a new set of heads for one of them (S5050/04 shaver and new SH50 heads) The heads that were in it were the Comfortcut heads which you no longer do. The replacement newer heads are the Multi Precision, which I ordered from Amazon. My problem is that they are simply not as good as my old Comfortcut blades. I have gone to great lengths to confirm this ie: shave half my face with the shaver that has the Multi Precision heads, and the other half with my other shaver (AT899/06) with the old Comfortcut heads. I have swapped the heads between the two shavers and found that the Multi Precision heads are just as poor in my AT899 shaver. I can get a decent shave from the Multi Precision heads, but it takes a long time (too long) I realise it is quite easy to fit the heads wrong, but this is not the case.

"Hello! I had to clean the water tank and to make it easier, I removed the Aquaclean filter which has been installed and activated a while ago.

I checked the manual, but there was nothing regarding my question.

So, i decided to no longer use the filter and threw it. Now, the aquaclean blue light cannot be deactivated, although i tried to do so as in the manual.

My nearly new CPAP is recalled and my Dr told me to stop using it immediately and get a new one ASAP. The equipment company said they haven't heard from your company and, until they do, any replacement unit is entirely my dime. That's not in the cards. Besides, I have to pay because you use shoddy equipment? Thanks for the non-notification by the way. I nearly missed it but my former doctor still had me on their email list.

"My daughter used to take breastmilk from this bottle, then she stopped. She gets rather fussy and mad when we try to feed her. This makes me nervous, as I am her sole source of food. Any advice?  Thank you.  Philips Avent sorry, I was unclear. She will not take the bottle at all now. She moves her head away from it and gets super cranky. I will look into a different nipple, but Im not sure if that will do the trick.  Philips Avent yes, she typically latches with no problem, unless she is overly tired or excited about the world around her. Do you have a link to the natural nipple?  Thanks!

Bought a  pack of your bottles recent but one of the nipples is not venting properly. Curious if there is anything you can do to help.   One of the nipples or teats is not venting the air so the nipple collapses into the bottle after my child eats from the bottle. It is not immediate but it does happen after a little bit. It appears to get more difficult to drink from. If we remove the bottle from the baby it lets air in the bottle and the nipple goes back to a normal position. This has to be done a few times per feeding. It appears to be only  nipple doing this. Any thoughts?,One of the nipples or teats is not venting properly.

"Hello 

I just wanted to say a huge thank you. We were one of the first to jump on the air fryer bandwagon around  years ago. We purchased your top of the range at the time for quite a price. We have been using it with no issues at all. In the last few months we have noticed it starting to smoke and smell like old oil. I looked at trying to clean it however it was in places that would have been unsafe to clean and areas I could not get too. So we decided to get a new one. We looked at the XXL but that was out of our budget. We saw that you still sell our original air fryer and we bought one there and then. We took the extra two year warranty but know we will probably not need it. 
Again this is just a thank you and to let you know that your original air fryer lasted  years without an issue.

". Good morning Phillips UK 
I have a Phillips beard or hair trimmer and a while ago my wife got the charging lead totally caught up in the vacuum, it ripped the wires out of the plug and frayed them. 
I tried for a good while to find someone who could try replace or even mend it, but was told it was not safe to do so. The plug and lead were disposed of by the shop who said it would be dangerous or impossible to mend. 
Since then I have just found this Phillips uk web site.  I will enclose  photos of the item in hope that you might be able to find a lead that will fit. Thanking you in anticipation. Barrie. nan nan nan No reply.  Not happy with the reply of not selling a replacement lead.  Also how long do you expect one to save a proof of purchase. I will buy a Braun that I have seen.

"Good afternoon. I hope you're well.

I've purchased a voucher through ING after seeing that it'd be cheaper to buy a Senseo Switch
Pad- en filterkoffiezetapparaat (HD6592/60) on your webstore with it.

However, once I received the voucher I noticed that the price you charge for the Senseo Switch on the Philips-ING webstore (EUR .99) is much higher than the price charged on the regular Philips webstore (EUR .99), which in itself is much higher than the price charged by every other online retailer (EUR .00).

Although I understand that the Philips-ING webstore can't have all Philips products, I find it unnecessary and disappointing that you have two different prices for the exact same device. Hi, Sander. Thank you for the reply. I'll get in touch with them. Take care! Thank you! ",Sander: I find it unnecessary and disappointing that you have two different prices for the exact same device. The price you charge for the Senseo Switch on the Philips-ING webstore (EUR.99) is much higher than the price charged on the regular Philips webstore (EUR.99),ing voucher says cheaper buy Senseo switch webstore,"Good afternoon. I hope you're well.

I've purchased a voucher through ING after seeing that it'd be cheaper to buy a Senseo Switch
Pad- en filterkoffiezetapparaat (HD6592/60) on your webstore with it.
�However, once I received the voucher I noticed that the price you charge for the Senseo Swift on the Philips-ING webstore (EUR.99) is much higher than the price charged on the regular Philips webstore(EUR 99), which in itself is much high than the fire charged by every other online retailer (EURE.00).

"I registered my Dreamstation CPAP unit to be updated as requested by Phillips, and we are waiting.......

Phillips says to contact the MD and the DME company for direction since I need to stop using the CPAP unit.  

My physician said to contact Phillips.

The DME company said to contact the MD as they have no information, cannot advise, and can only offer to sell me a new or refurbished unit.     

Also, my insurance WILL NOT pay for a replacement CPAP since I have another year to go on the defective one I have..... that I cannot use.

And on the phillips website it says: 
or patients using affected BiLevel PAP and CPAP devices: Discontinue use of your device and work with your physician or Durable Medical Equipment (DME) provider to determine the most appropriate options for continued treatment........"" 

SO ONCE AGAIN, the consumer, the patient is the loser. Please let me know if there is any other direction.

"As a new owner of a DreamStation , how to ramp it down during therapy as there in no special button like the DreamStation . Thank you very much. Thank you for the information but it did not answer my specific question. Again, on the DreamStation , there is a button to ramp down excess air during sleep therapy when the pressure increases. HOW DO I ACHIEVE THE SAME with the DreamStation  during SLEEP therapy and NOT settings? Thank you very much. Email:  Canada Thank you. My question is not answered. During sleep if the ramp pressure gets very high and wakes me up, how do I ramp it down? On DreamStation  there was a button to do so? What do you do with DreamStation  as there is no button anymore?
