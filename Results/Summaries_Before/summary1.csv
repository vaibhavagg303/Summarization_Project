 Hi My fridge ice maker was repaired a few months ago. Then it stopped cooling. Had that fixed. Now it stopped making ice again.

"Support   Sim card keeps disappearing Hello I want to do a warranty claim but everytime I try, it stops me.  The sim slot frequently drops signal/service/connectivity. It's not my carrier. I've tried two different carriers. Three different sims. They all have done this. It's very intermittent. It won't happen for a week or so. Then happens alot for a few days. Hard reset doesn't help. Removing the sim is a temporary fix and then it will happen again.  I've done that three times over the past week. It doesn't help.  Just did it on Sunday and the sim did it again on Monday and yesterday.   Are they sending a replacement while I don't have my device?

Rf28r7201sr/aa Yes I also done my research and have found this is a KNOWN issue We have to pull the ice maker out and clean out the ice that freezes in the bottom of the ice maker and tray  at least once a week.  b2c43bm601463w Its very frustrating.  We paid over $2000 for this refrigerator.  For that much money we shouldn't have any issues. Its just so disappointing and frustrating. We can't afford another unit but we live in the south and MUST have ice especially in the upcoming months.  I really appreciate that. Thank you.  Thank you!!  James Taylor  -338-5472

We have to pull the ice maker out and clean out the ice that freezes in the bottom of the ice maker and tray at least once a week.,Support   Terrible icemaker that constantly freezes.  Rf28r7201sr/aa Yes I also done my research and have found this is a KNOWN issue We have to pull the ice maker out and clean out the ice that freezes in the bottom of the ice makers and tray  at least once a week.  b2c43bm601463w Its very frustrating.

We can't afford another unit but we live in the south and MUST have ice especially in the upcoming months.  I really appreciate that. Thank you.  Thank you!!

 Ok No not savy. Thank you. Ok Yes. Sir I  am having a problem turning my phone off. Holding both buttons yo turn off. Is that the bottom or top button? That seems to control the sound. Ok Bixby comes up each time and I  ask it to power off. I went to the Bixby icon on my desk top and asked it to reboot and so it did. The phone is on and I  resent the photos and it worked. I  also opened the the text that was sent to me and I received  it. Looking good. THANK YOU.
